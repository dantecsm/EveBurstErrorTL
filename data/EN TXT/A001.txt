[Kojiroh] I'm finally back in my office...
[Kojiroh] It can't be this late already! ...Time\flies.
[Kojiroh] ...Think I'll call it a day.
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah, where's the little rascal...
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] Huh? He's not here...
[Kojiroh] He's not under the sheets...
[Kojiroh] Under the pillow?!
I take a peek.
[Kojiroh] Where the hell could he be?
[Kojiroh] Uh-oh... Oh shit!

I rummage through my stuff...
[Kojiroh] Let's see...
[Kojiroh] I'm not missing any valuables...
[Kojiroh] But then, even my valuables aren't so\valuable...
[Kojiroh] My God! The computer data!?!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] The light isn't blinking and the seal\isn't broken... Everything's okay.

The pills shake inside the container.
[Kojiroh] I'll just set it here on the table... Ah,\he ain't listening.

[Kojiroh] I'm back at the office...
[Kojiroh] Where is that little brat...
[Kojiroh] He's sleeping well... But he sure is\dirty...
[Kojiroh] Shit... I can't just leave him here like\this...
[Kojiroh] Come on, kiddo... Can you walk?
[Boy] This headache... It's killing me...
[Kojiroh] This ain't good.
[Kojiroh] Maybe I'll let him sleep on the chair in\the office...
[Kojiroh] Upsie-daisy...
[Kojiroh] He's not too as heavy as I thought he\might be...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] But he's just one trouble after\another...
[Kojiroh] Today just isn't my day...
[Kojiroh] Hey! Are you even listening?
[Boy] My head is pounding... Oww...
[Kojiroh] Geez...
[Kojiroh] Why is it that I attract so much trouble\in life?
[Kojiroh] Maybe I was born under a bad sign...
[Kojiroh] Hm...
[Kojiroh] Now, I'll just put him in the chair...
[Kojiroh] Ah, man... There're too many documents\scattered on it.
[Kojiroh] I thought about cleaning this place up a\bit, but I never got my act together.
[Kojiroh] There's no way this kid's sleeping in my\bed...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Oh well. I will give him my bed.
I lay him down carefully, trying not to wake him up.
001
[Kojiroh] Whew...
[Kojiroh] I actually managed to carry the little\shit all the way to my bed.
[Kojiroh] But he's dirty as hell. Doesn't this kid\ever bathe?
[Kojiroh] Hey, you little runt! You listening?!
[Boy] Zzzz...
[Kojiroh] Damn.
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah, he mentioned having a\headache...
[Kojiroh] I should have some medicine around here\somewhere.
I shuffle through the mess, looking for pills...
[Kojiroh] Why do I have to do all this? I ain't his\mother.
I keep rummaging through the mess...
[Kojiroh] Nothing...
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] Come to think of it, I need to go\shopping. Maybe I'll get some aspirin while I'm at\it.
[Kojiroh] Seems crazy, but I need to replenish my\supplies. I'm not going to the store for the brat\though.
[Kojiroh] Headache medicine should be easy to\find...

[Kojiroh] What the hell..?

[Kojiroh] Well, I'm back again...
The telephone rings...
[Kojiroh] Who could be calling at this hour?
Click.
[Kojiroh] Hello, this is the Amagi Private\Detective Office...
[Voice] ...
[Kojiroh] Amagi Private Detective Office, can I\help you? Hello?
[Voice] ...
[Kojiroh] Listen.　Speak up or hang up.
[Voice] ...
[Kojiroh] Hey man, I don't have time to screw\around with you...
[Glen] Kojiroh, it's me...
[Kojiroh] Glen? Are you checking my voice again?
[Glen] You could say that...
[Kojiroh] So, what's up? Any news?
[Glen] Yeah. I just got some new information...\Lots of it.
[Kojiroh] You don't sound so hot... Is it bad news?
[Glen] I just spoke to my contact, and he only made\matters more confusing.
[Kojiroh] I see...
[Glen] That painting ain't no masterpiece... It\ain't worth shit.
[Kojiroh] Are you telling me that thing\is...Worthless?
[Glen] Exactly...
[Kojiroh] So it's no van Gogh...
[Glen] Not quite.
[Kojiroh] Would it be wrong to assume it has\something to do with tax evasion?
[Glen] Perhaps you should treat this robbery as a\special case.
[Kojiroh] That's for me to decide.
[Glen] Perhaps the painting is a fake.
[Kojiroh] Your contact is trustworthy, and he says\it's worthless?
[Glen] Yes...
[Kojiroh] Alright... Let me know if you hear\anything more...
[Glen] No problem.
I hang up the phone.
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] So it's crap, basically...
[Kojiroh] This isn't what I expected. Kou was\actually right.
[Kojiroh] He said he was heartbroken because he\couldn't forget about his dead wife.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I'm not exactly satisfied with his\explanation.

[Kojiroh] Where the hell am I supposed to find the\missing painting?

[Kojiroh] This is the strangest case I've ever been\given.
[Kojiroh] Then again, I've hardly been getting any\cases at all, recently.
[Kojiroh] But now it's time to show everyone what\I'm made of.

[Kojiroh] I have to arrange my thoughts before I\can really sleep.
　About the painting
　About Kou
　About Yayoi
　About Nikaido
　About Glen
　About Akane
　Many things
[Kojiroh] I'll continue with this tomorrow...
[Kojiroh] I'm finally getting sleepy...
[Kojiroh] Today was one hell of a day.
[Kojiroh] But at least I have a new case to work\on...
[Kojiroh] I have to pay Akane for getting me hired\by Kou...
[Kojiroh] The investigation's going nowhere,\Yayoi's against me... Shit.
[Kojiroh] And now I'm stuck with some little\girl...
[Kojiroh] I wonder if she's sleeping okay...
[Kojiroh] She's sleeping in my soft bed... I better\not hear any lip from her.
[Kojiroh] I've been swamped with bad luck today...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I wonder how Yayoi's gonna attack this\case...
[Kojiroh] And Nikaido...
[Kojiroh] He said he found a clue...
[Kojiroh] I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious.\I wonder what it is...
[Kojiroh] No matter what happens, I can't lose to\Katsuragi Private Detective Offices...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Well, I'll go to the library tomorrow and\look for more information.
[Kojiroh] I might find more clues...
[Kojiroh] Anything helps... I'll get that Matsuno\girl to help me out.
[Kojiroh] The only thing to do now is sleep...

[Kojiroh] I was asked to find the missing\painting...
[Kojiroh] Who could have it? It's suppose to be\used in memorial services...
[Kojiroh] He said something about an acquaintance\from work... Maybe someone in the reception room.
[Kojiroh] Including today, I only have three days\to look for this painting.
[Kojiroh] It looks like Islamic art.
[Kojiroh] I don't know when it "disappeared". It's\possibly stolen...
[Kojiroh] But why would anyone steal it?
[Kojiroh] There are so many clues left to be\found...
[Kojiroh] It's like if the burglar want's to be\found.
[Kojiroh] How about the mud on the window sill...\It was nice to see the tracks leading straight to\the painting.
[Kojiroh] These details go on forever.
[Kojiroh] I sense something fishy going on...
[Kojiroh] But I don't know what that sense is\trying to tell me.
[Kojiroh] Okay. Basically, Kou hired some\heavy-duty detectives to find his missing painting.
[Kojiroh] It's a little strange, but who am I to\criticize?
[Kojiroh] I'll give my job 100% effort.
[Kojiroh] I'll find that painting somehow.
[Kojiroh] I'm not gonna rack my brains trying to\figure out why it was lost.
[Kojiroh] I'm only paid to find the painting...
[Kojiroh] Be it his wife's third anniversary, tax\evasion... It's not problem.
[Kojiroh] I'll find that painting, and Kou will pay\me.
[Kojiroh] I have to perform my job with perfect\professionalism.

[Kojiroh] I didn't think Yayoi was involved with\this case, too...
[Kojiroh] It's been three months since we last\met... She hasn't changed a bit.
[Kojiroh] Their investigation actually started\several days ago...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Yayoi doesn't think this is a simple\robbery either.
[Kojiroh] But Nikaido's opinion was a bit different\than hers.
[Kojiroh] I'll never lose to the Katsuragi Private\Detective Offices...

[Kojiroh] That's one information source I'll be\sure to use.
[Kojiroh] And Glen's real name isn't "Glen." He\uses that as a nick-name.
[Kojiroh] Address unknown. Age unknown... He uses a\cellular whenever he calls people.
[Kojiroh] I think I'm playing with fire here...
[Kojiroh] But then, danger's my middle name. I\can't be clean all the time...
[Kojiroh] Glen has some pretty extraordinary means\of gathering information. And it'll cost me a\pretty penny to obtain that illegal info.
[Kojiroh] Shit, legal or illegal, info is info.\There're no morals involved with quality\information.
[Kojiroh] Yayoi always hated my reasoning.
[Kojiroh] Glen says there's no artistic value in\that painting. It's just cheap crap.
[Kojiroh] I've learned to believe what he says.
[Kojiroh] He also said he was hired by a major\client.
[Kojiroh] I hope he's not getting himself into\something more than he can't handle.

[Kojiroh] That Akane...
[Kojiroh] She's a foxy dame.
[Kojiroh] She's a reporter, a one-woman paparazzo.
[Kojiroh] She may look cute on the outside, but I\can't let her trick me.
[Kojiroh] She'll do anything to get what she\wants...
[Kojiroh] She's a workaholic, and lets nothing\stand in her way.
[Kojiroh] But this time she brought the case to me.\I'm obliged to solve it.
[Kojiroh] She would be so much cuter if she didn't\charge me that intoductory fee.
[Kojiroh] And she seems to be interested in how I'm\taking up this case.
[Kojiroh] Could 50.000 yen really be so important?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Yeah, I guess it could.

[Kojiroh] Nikaido thinks a thief is at the center\of this investigation...
[Kojiroh] I, however, share a different view.
[Kojiroh] But I AM interested in what kind of clue\he found.
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah... I made a note in my\pocketbook: "Contact M."
[Kojiroh] I wonder if it has anything to do with\this investigation.
[Kojiroh] This guy's actually helping me out quite\a bit... Thanks, man.
[Kojiroh] I'll pay him back by solving the case.

[Kojiroh] It's the 3rd anniversary of his wife's\death, and he wants me to find his friend's\painting.
[Kojiroh] At first I thought it was tax evasion...\But it's just a worthless piece of art.
[Kojiroh] Basically, Kou's words do have some\credibility to them.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Wait... I can't jump to too many\conclusions at once, here.
[Kojiroh] I'd better relax for a while, and　Speak\politely... All I know is that he's a rich, fat\bastard.
[Kojiroh] But he pisses me off for some reason.
[Kojiroh] For now I'll just concentrate on the case\at hand...
[Kojiroh] On one hand it looks like a robbery. But\then, it also looks like a crock of shit.
[Kojiroh] Why on earth would he want that cheap\thing so much...?
[Kojiroh] Glen said it was worthless, and he knows\his art...
[Kojiroh] Kou just wants me to inform him when I\find it.
[Kojiroh] I'll never understand the rich...
[Kojiroh] It must have something to do with his\wife, and the 3rd anniversary of her passing away.
001
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] At least I was able to put the little\girl to bed...
[Kojiroh] It's times like this when I wish Yayoi\was here.
[Kojiroh] Oh well...

[Kojiroh] Where could he have gone?
[Kojiroh] The lights are a little warm, but...\Brrr!
[Kojiroh] I need my bath! Here I come!
[Kojiroh] The lights are dim... There's no way he\could've escaped.
[Kojiroh] The lights are dim...
[Kojiroh] He couldn't have escaped...
[Kojiroh] Where could he have gone?
[Kojiroh] Looks like a good time to dance on the\table... How 'bout it?
[Kojiroh] I'm too cold... I need to hop in the\bath.
[Kojiroh] The aspirin box is open...
[Kojiroh] He must've took the medicine before\leaving.
[Kojiroh] Uh-oh... The aspirin box is open...
[Kojiroh] At least he'll feel better.

[Kojiroh] You want me to go out looking like this?
[Kojiroh] It's cold... I need to get into the tub.

[Kojiroh] I don't own very much, do I...
[Kojiroh] Everything's scattered around the room.\Nothing's under the desk...
[Kojiroh] Ha, ha, ha... Could he be under the desk?
[Kojiroh] Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Wham!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] My room's pretty messy...
[Kojiroh] The beer sure was good...
[Kojiroh] No one's in here, obviously.
[Kojiroh] How about... Here!
Click...
[Kojiroh] Take a look at all these beers! Now\THAT'S a fridge.
I take a few swigs.
[Kojiroh] A real man doesn't mind losing a few\brain cells.
[Kojiroh] I'm not getting any radio waves from\outer space...
[Kojiroh] Now I'm talking crazy...
[Kojiroh] Yes! The mystery of the universe!
[Kojiroh] Wait... I can sense signals coming from\Orion...
[Kojiroh] Ahh, he's ramming his sword up Alpha\Centauri...
[Kojiroh] It was bound to happen...
[Kojiroh] I don't want to cross the River Styx...
[Kojiroh] One more beer and I'll be able to hear\the spiritual realm!
[Kojiroh] The far shore of the River Styx... I can\see them beckoning.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I'm a little scared now...

[Kojiroh] I organize all my info on that computer.

[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] More strange data... What could it be...
[Kojiroh] Requesting urgent contact with 'M'...\"M"?
[Kojiroh] What could 'M' possibly mean?
[Kojiroh] Could it be an initial for someone's last\name?
[Kojiroh] Why don't they just say the whole name?
[Kojiroh] Maybe it's not a name. I always jump to\conclusions.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] What words begin with 'M'? ...Masturbate?
[Kojiroh] "Masako?" I could be "Mistaken"...
[Kojiroh] Well, maybe Nikaido was flustered with\the urgency, and just jotted it down in a hurry.
[Kojiroh] But it makes me wonder...
[Kojiroh] Anything else? ...Nope. All done.
[Kojiroh] Let's see category 2... Well, well.
[Kojiroh] According to this, a robbery seems to be\more likely... Oh! Now this is what I was looking\for.
[Kojiroh] But the date has been updated to\yesterday's...
[Kojiroh] Bad timing... The data has just been\updated.
[Kojiroh] This only contains the new data... I\wanted to take a few steps back.
[Kojiroh] Well hey, this is better than nothing.
[Kojiroh] I see...
[Kojiroh] This analysis ain't so bad. Yayoi has a\habit of taking notes of her analysis.
[Kojiroh] Basically, this is Yayoi's analysis and\reasoning.
[Kojiroh] It appears the Katsuragi Offices are\approaching this as a theft...
[Kojiroh] Well, that's one way of looking at it.\I'm gonna take a different approach.
[Kojiroh] There's no more data to look up...
[Kojiroh] Anything else? ...Nope.
[Kojiroh] Shit. I just wasted my time with this\boring data...
[Kojiroh] I'll save it...
[Kojiroh] Anything else...?
[Kojiroh] Hey, Kou's personal data is in here.
[Kojiroh] And I almost missed this data on a\woman...
[Kojiroh] Well, whadda ya know... He works at Yale\International School.
[Kojiroh] Yale International School?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Could that fat old bastard be working at\the international school?
[Kojiroh] He's probably the janitor...
[Kojiroh] But how could an old janitor become so\prosperous??
[Kojiroh] Let's see... Here's the school address.
[Kojiroh] Whadda ya know? Not too far from here.
[Kojiroh] I'll go there and take a look.
[Kojiroh] I should check into this data thoroughly.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Wow... There's even data on Akane.
[Kojiroh] Nikaido sure knows how to obtain\information.
[Kojiroh] I understand wanting to know about women,\but this is going a little overboard.
[Kojiroh] Take a look at this...
[Kojiroh] Wow... Akane's got some big tits.
[Kojiroh] Her birthday is... What the hell?!? That\immature girl's already 22!
[Kojiroh] It's hard to believe, but I consider\Nikaido's data to be quite reliable.
[Kojiroh] Huh?
[Kojiroh] According to this date, Akane's birthday\is...tomorrow.
[Kojiroh] That bitch... On my birthday, she gave me\chopsticks.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I'll show her some chopsticks of my own!\Heh, heh...
[Kojiroh] But this isn't the data category I want\to look up.
[Kojiroh] Just what DO I want to look up,\anyway...?
[Kojiroh] How many profiles are in this thing?!?
[Kojiroh] Wow... There's even info on Yayoi...
[Kojiroh] ...All the way down to her measurements!
[Kojiroh] What the hell is she doing at the\office...
[Kojiroh] Hey, that ain't her waist size... She's\slimmer than that. Around 56 cm.
[Kojiroh] Then again, my data was 3 months old. She\might have gained some weight.
[Kojiroh] But no one updates that data...
[Kojiroh] And this ain't the info I'm looking for.
[Kojiroh] How about data category 1...
[Kojiroh] Kaori Iida, Yoshiko Arai, Emi\Tsuchihashi, Kanako Ito, Yukari Ishii... Who are\these babes?
[Kojiroh] Hey, here are their phone numbers and\addresses... And their measurements!
[Kojiroh] Hey, here's some data on Keiko, the new\secretary... I'll take notes... I may be able to\get into her pants.

[Woman's voice] Keiko?! This is the boss, Yayoi\Katsuragi...
Click.
[Kojiroh] Oh, man! That was a close one...
[Kojiroh] She'd kill me if she knew it was me.
[Kojiroh] You want me to call Katsuragi Private\Detective Offices?
[Kojiroh] Here goes...
I'm dialing...
It's ringing...
Someone picks up...
[Woman's voice] Hello, Katsuragi Private Detective\Offices.
[Kojiroh] (Oh! It's Keiko, the rookie!)
[Kojiroh] Hey, sweetie...
[Woman's voice] I'll kill you, if you perverts call\one more time!
Click!
[Kojiroh] Oh boy...
[Kojiroh] I think I'm deaf...
[Kojiroh] He wasn't there when I called a second\ago...
[Kojiroh] Kou, huh...? Well, his number should be\written on the fax...
[Kojiroh] I'm dialing...
I wonder if he's home...
It's ringing...
Still no answer.
[Kojiroh] I don't think he's in...
Click.
　Missing painting
　Kou
　Katsuragi Offices
　Akane
[Kojiroh] Maybe Glen knows what's going on.
[Kojiroh] I'll call him right away.
[Kojiroh] I wonder if his house has a burglar\alarm...
[Kojiroh] Such big houses usually have those\systems installed.
[Kojiroh] But still... The painting seems to have\been ripped off.
[Kojiroh] But a pro would consider an underground\passage as a possibility.
[Kojiroh] My contacts would definitely hear about\any of that critical information.
[Kojiroh] I'll give Glen a call.
[Kojiroh] He's my main source of info. He has the\best contacts.
[Kojiroh] Anything's a possibility. I've got to\establish a firm groundwork.
[Kojiroh] Time is of the essence. I'll call Glen\now.
[Kojiroh] It's my job to find that painting...
[Kojiroh] And it's not good being this clueless.
[Kojiroh] Who would steal such a small painting?
[Kojiroh] I think the painting's for a memorial\service... It's actually a picture, I guess.
I shuffle around for the painting.
[Kojiroh] Here it is.
s10
[Kojiroh] This is what all the fuss is about.
[Kojiroh] I can't believe anyone could paint\something the size of a matchstick.
[Kojiroh] He said it was Islamic...
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah! I was given a document...
I look for the paper.
[Kojiroh] Well, well... The birthdate is unknown...\Sir Lastma Gurrita Lachal...
[Kojiroh] What the hell kind of a name is that!?!\He paints very impressionistic backgrounds, heavily\based on the theme of the spirit's comfort.
[Kojiroh] The spirit's comfort?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Well at least the painting appears to\have some history to it...
[Kojiroh] Basically, this useless data teaches me\nothing special.
001
[Kojiroh] And this character, Kou...
[Kojiroh] He's not exactly suspicious, but there's\something weird about him.
[Kojiroh] According to Akane, he's from China...
[Kojiroh] He was rather polite, and was an\excellent host when I visited him.
[Kojiroh] I feel bad for suspecting him of tax\evasion.
[Kojiroh] An acquaintance wanted to borrow the\painting for a memorial service, and that's when he\noticed it was missing.
[Kojiroh] There's a strong possibility it was\stolen.
[Kojiroh] He may be telling the truth about the\third anniversary of his wife's death.
[Kojiroh] Well, I'm glad he hired a detective\instead of the cops. It's understandable he'd want\to keep this a secret.
[Kojiroh] Whatever happens, I won't lose to Yayoi's\people...
[Kojiroh] ...I'd better get back to Nikaido's data.
[Kojiroh] This guy's an idiot... He just let vital\information fall through his hands.
[Kojiroh] Well, maybe he's not such an idiot if\he's getting laid. It's a crazy world out there...
[Kojiroh] He's been preying on women ever since I\was at Katsuragi Private Detective Offices...
[Kojiroh] He's probably still in love with Yayoi...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Shit. Why the hell am I so frustrated?
[Kojiroh] It's been over between us for a long\time...
[Kojiroh] I wonder how far into the investigation\she's gotten.
[Kojiroh] I can't help but wonder...
[Kojiroh] I hate working on cases in competition\with other detective offices.
[Kojiroh] I've heard of fast-food chains competing\with one another, but this is the first time I've\seen detective offices compete.
[Kojiroh] And Katsuragi Private Detective Offices\are professionals.
[Kojiroh] I only wish Yayoi wasn't so cold to me\today.
[Kojiroh] Whether I solve this case or not, this is\gonna be tough...
[Kojiroh] Akane likes sadism and masochism...
[Kojiroh] I don't know what the hell that entails.
[Kojiroh] She said she would give the case to\Katsuragi, if I didn't want it.
[Kojiroh] She knew Katsuragi could do it, but she\gave the case to me.
[Kojiroh] But then, there is that five thousand\dollars at stake.
[Kojiroh] She oughtta come here again... I'll show\her some sadism and masochism of my own.
[Kojiroh] What kind of punishment is that?
[Kojiroh] Ah, who the hell cares.
　Terminal
0290
[Kojiroh] There's no need to use it now.
[Kojiroh] I'm just about to see Glen.
001
[Kojiroh] Okay, everything here is all set.
[Kojiroh] I'll take this electronic organizer and\return it to Nikaido.
0290
[Kojiroh] Good... The data has been forwarded.
[Kojiroh] I'll just disconnect this cable, and...
Click.
[Kojiroh] This should do it.
001
[Kojiroh] I've got the electronic organizer. I'll\give it back to Nikaido.
[Kojiroh] You want to use the terminal again?
[Kojiroh] I don't think it's done processing yet.
0290
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] It's not finished yet.
001
[Kojiroh] Why don't we think a little longer?
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah... I swiped some interesting\stuff from Nikaido...
[Kojiroh] I'll enter his data into the terminal.
0290
[Kojiroh] First I have to turn on the switch.
The terminal spatters out sounds as it comes to\life.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] This damn thing takes forever to boot up.
Now it's beeping.
[Kojiroh] Now I'll just connect the electronic\organizer to this cable...
[Kojiroh] Then I'll connect the terminal interface\with the forwarding address.
[Kojiroh] And now it's activated!
The terminal continues spattering about.
[Kojiroh] Transmitting speed, 300BPS... This is\some slow shit.
[Kojiroh] Maybe Nikaido's organizer is to blame for\the slow speed.
[Kojiroh] This may take some time.
[Kojiroh] I'll do some more thinking over there...

[Kojiroh] This place is dark and messy, but it's a\formal office.
[Kojiroh] I know what I'm talking about... I'm the\owner.
[Kojiroh] This is my private detective office...
[Kojiroh] I renovated this warehouse myself... The\location could be better. It's just a port.
[Kojiroh] The good news is, rent is dirt cheap...\The bad news is, it's hard to find clients here.
[Kojiroh] Ha, ha... How do you like that?
[Kojiroh] The lights are a bit dim. I'll take care\of it someday...
[Kojiroh] ...If I ever get the cash.
[Kojiroh] The lights are dim...
[Kojiroh] These lights came with this place when I\got it...
[Kojiroh] Pretty soon it'll be time for a change.
[Kojiroh] But I can't afford it now. Oh, well...
[Kojiroh] Now I use it as a dinner table.
[Kojiroh] It's pretty convenient, you know.
[Kojiroh] It looks like a small table...
[Kojiroh] But it's all-purpose. I can read the\paper, eat dinner, and type documents on this\thing.
[Kojiroh] I can even stack a mountain of magazines\on it.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Geez... I'm getting carried away.
[Kojiroh] It's finished processing... I can return\this thing to it's owner.
[Kojiroh] Jesus, this is slow... It's still being\entered.
[Kojiroh] I have to hurry up and input my stuff\into this thing.
[Kojiroh] Right now, my computer is on the table.\It's packed with information.
[Kojiroh] I haven't been using it very much\lately...
[Kojiroh] This device was custom made for me only.\If anyone else uses it, the little light flashes.
[Kojiroh] Of course, they could use it all they\want if they stole it. Ha, ha...
[Kojiroh] The light isn't blinking, of course...
[Kojiroh] I don't know if this stuff is important,\but at least it's information.
[Kojiroh] I'll enter that into the terminal.
[Kojiroh] Is it about what's in the middle of the\screen in the second floor?
[Kojiroh] What the hell's a screen? I care about\the details, you know.
[Kojiroh] The terminal's on the desk, set up in a\real mess... This thing can do just about anything.
[Kojiroh] My equipment is all set up to send and\receive data.
[Kojiroh] I can access the internet without even\going through a provider.
[Kojiroh] Information is the most important thing\in the world, you see.
　Go outside
[Kojiroh] Okay, let's take a walk.
a002
[Kojiroh] I'll take Nikaido's electric pocket\organizer with me.
[Kojiroh] I'll return it to him the next time I see\him.
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah, I almost forgot about my meeting\with Glen.
[Kojiroh] It's off to the cocktail lounge I go.
[Kojiroh] Hey, wasn't I just entering the data from\the electronic organizer?
[Kojiroh] It should be finished forwarding.
[Kojiroh] I'd like to think things over just a bit\more...
[Kojiroh] Uhh, I'd like to think things over just a\bit more...
[Kojiroh] Why don't I go outside a little later?
[Kojiroh] This is my private detective office...
[Kojiroh] Let's go to Kou's house ASAP.
