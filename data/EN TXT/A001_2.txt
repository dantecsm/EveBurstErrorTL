[Kojiroh] Purin, you're not my maid. You don't have\to do all that.
[Purin] But...
[Kojiroh] Did you call your guardian?
[Purin] Yep.

[Kojiroh] Just hold on a minute.
[Girl] What is it?
[Kojiroh] We need to talk.
[Girl] What is it?
[Kojiroh] Who the hell are you?
[Girl] Excuse me?
[Kojiroh] I'm asking who you are.
[Girl] You rescued me from those bad guys last\night.
[Kojiroh] I know that...
[Girl] ...
[Kojiroh] (Maybe I'm not getting through to her...)
[Kojiroh] (Or maybe she's just playing dumb...)
[Kojiroh] What's your name?
[Girl] You can call me Purin.
[Kojiroh] Purin?
[Purin] Yes?
[Kojiroh] Purins your name?
[Purin] Is there something wrong with my name?

I feel something soft.
[Kojiroh] What the...?
It's... Soft and firm...
[Kojiroh] What the hell is this?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] No, it couldn't be...
A soft moan is heard.

She snores.
[Kojiroh] Do you hear me? Go sleep over there!
She snores.

[Kojiroh] Why me? Why me...? What the hell did I\ever do?
[Kojiroh] I'm not taking any responsibility if I do\something kinky when I'm asleep.
[Girl] Heh?
[Kojiroh] Don't blame me if you're pregnant by\morning!
Zzz...

[Kojiroh] Nice body too.
I regain my senses.

[Kojiroh] I'm not THAT desperate! I like 'em my\age.
[Kojiroh] But she has a nice tan and... She's\BLOND...
[Kojiroh] I get it, she's one of those Californian\surfers.
[Kojiroh] Nah...

[Kojiroh] I'll have to have a little chat with her\in the morning.

[Kojiroh] She's... Warm...
[Kojiroh] She can be my personal heater...

[Kojiroh] What a day...
[Kojiroh] I end up babysitting a girl, I get a\bizarre case from a client, and it seems like I'm\competing against Katsuragi Offices.
[Kojiroh] I'm sorry guys, but this case is mine.
[Kojiroh] Nikaido might have something up his\sleeves, but if I can solve the case, fame is all\mine.
[Kojiroh] I need to beat Katsuragi Offices to make\a name for my office.
[Kojiroh] Yayoi seems to have problems too, right\now.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] No, no. I'm not gonna go soft. I need to\beat them on this case.
[Kojiroh] If I don't win, then that means I'm the\one who's gonna hit the wall first.
[Kojiroh] And there'll be nothing for me to do.
[Kojiroh] I'm doing this at any cost...

[Kojiroh] I guess he wanted make a statement for\his painting...
[Kojiroh] Damn artists... What the hell are they\thinking...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I know... It bugs me too...
[Kojiroh] I'll ask Kou when I see him next time.
I sit in front of the terminal and starting working.
[Kojiroh] This should be good enough.
[Kojiroh] The data's all in the terminal now.
[Kojiroh] Like I really believe in a curse...
[Kojiroh] You always hear these stories about\people that die in strange ways.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Oh wait, there was that strange comment\made by the author...
[Kojiroh] I jotted it down on the memo pad\somewhere...
I flip through the pages.
[Kojiroh] There it is... Let's see...
[Kojiroh] It says, "To those who lay hands on me,\their punishment will be severe and thou shall\suffer in the fires of hell by God's blade..."
[Kojiroh] ...?
[Kojiroh] What the hell does that mean?
[Kojiroh] Well, the "To those who lay hands..."\part...
[Kojiroh] Those who lay hands on what? His\painting? Himself?
[Kojiroh] "...lay hands..." Maybe it means to get\involved...
[Kojiroh] To get involved with the painting?
[Kojiroh] What...?
[Kojiroh] "...the punishment will be severe..."
[Kojiroh] Well, that's easy. It's pretty literal,\if you ask me.
[Kojiroh] It means that there'll be severe\consequences for someone who messes with the\painting.
[Kojiroh] But I wonder what kind of punishment...?
[Kojiroh] Moving on... Yeah, talk about Greek.
[Kojiroh] "...thou shall suffer in the fire of hell\by God's blade." What the heck?
[Kojiroh] "Thou shall suffer in the fire of\hell..."
[Kojiroh] I don't know what it exactly means but it\doesn't sound pleasant.
[Kojiroh] "By God's blade." Thats a tricky one.
[Kojiroh] God's blade?
[Kojiroh] God has a sword? Maybe a kitchen knife?
[Kojiroh] Shit... I know I should've studied poetry\more.
[Kojiroh] I haven't gotta clue.
[Kojiroh] Shit...
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah, it's that author with that\messed up name.
[Kojiroh] I looked up his work at the library, and\his name was found in a occult dictionary.
[Kojiroh] People who have been involved with the\painting have either died, or vanished.
[Kojiroh] There are at least a couple dozen people\already dead or missing.
[Kojiroh] People say that the painting is cursed,\but that's just bullshit. Someone is behind all\this.
[Kojiroh] It's all part of the game.
[Kojiroh] And someone's gonna go down...
[Kojiroh] I didn't know Kou was into occult stuff.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Maybe Purin knows something... She's\Islamic.
[Kojiroh] That's kinda stupid.
[Kojiroh] It's like saying all Americans know who\Monica Lewinsky is.
[Kojiroh] Then again, bad example.
[Kojiroh] Hey Purin!
[Purin] Yes?
[Kojiroh] Do you know anything about Islamic art?
[Purin] Islamic art?
[Kojiroh] Right.
[Purin] Nope... Not a thing.
[Kojiroh] That's what I thought.
[Kojiroh] He's such an ass.
[Kojiroh] He's the Principal at an international\school. No wonder he's loaded.
[Kojiroh] Kou's looking for that painting. It seems\like that's all he's been doing, lately.
[Kojiroh] I don't get him... What's he really\thinking?
[Kojiroh] He didn't mention a thing about the\author I looked up at the library.
[Kojiroh] Maybe he just didn't know...
[Kojiroh] Was it stolen? Or is there something more\to it?
[Kojiroh] Maybe it really wasn't stolen...
[Kojiroh] Or maybe it really was stolen.
[Kojiroh] It just bugs me that it's so obvious.
[Kojiroh] Dirt left by the window sill, a lock\that's been picked, and a trail of foot prints\leading to it...
[Kojiroh] And the security system that somehow\never went off.
[Kojiroh] Something's wrong... Everything just\falls into its place too easily.
[Kojiroh] It's either the work of a professional or\an idiot.
[Kojiroh] But if it was a professional job, would\they leave dirt on the window sill?
[Kojiroh] It could be a trap to mislead me\though...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Okay, let's look at it from another\point-of-view. If it was made to look like a\burglary, then who... And for what reason?
[Kojiroh] Kou...?
[Kojiroh] Nah...
[Kojiroh] Then he wouldn't be spending all this\money hiring investigators.
[Kojiroh] I guess I need to go back to the scene of\the crime again.
[Kojiroh] Let's think this through from the\beginning.
[Kojiroh] I was hired to look for that weird ass\painting.
[Kojiroh] The painting was kept by Kou's\acquaintance. It was used as an item to mourn the\dead.
[Kojiroh] But when Kou came back for it, the\painting wasn't there...
[Kojiroh] Burglary is just one of the\possibilities.
[Kojiroh] I got two days to find that painting.
[Kojiroh] My job is to find where the painting\is... So I just have to find it and report... I\don't need to bring it back.
[Kojiroh] I wonder if there's a reason why he\doesn't want me to bring it back...?
[Kojiroh] He just doubled my fee and told me not to\ask any more questions...

[Kojiroh] My job is to find this painting.
[Kojiroh] And there's hardly any clues.
I laugh a little.

[Kojiroh] This is a Customized Glock 22.
[Kojiroh] It's my protector.

[Kojiroh] A Customized Glock 22... It's my favorite\gun.
[Kojiroh] It's got a laser sight for better\accuracy.
[Kojiroh] In this line of business, you never know\who you come across.
[Kojiroh] Of course, I use it mostly to scare them.
[Kojiroh] When I have to shoot, I aim for the legs.

[Kojiroh] Stop checking my cash...
[Kojiroh] I don't want to check until this case is\solved.
[Kojiroh] Let's not.
[Kojiroh] There's a girl here.
[Kojiroh] What are you gonna do with it?
　Surroundings
　Lights
　Table
　Work Desk
[Kojiroh] This is my office.
[Kojiroh] It's fairly clean, thanks to Purin.
[Kojiroh] The office does look cleaner than it did\yesterday.
[Kojiroh] And it's all thanks to Purin.
[Kojiroh] She seems like a good girl.
[Kojiroh] The lights are always on.
[Kojiroh] I wonder what happened to the utility\bill?
[Kojiroh] It's always on, days and nights.
[Kojiroh] I wonder how much the utility bill is?
[Kojiroh] Let's not think about that anymore.
[Kojiroh] It's a table. It's got empty cans and\magazines stashed on top.
[Kojiroh] Purin cleans it up, and it's my job to\get it messy.
[Kojiroh] It can be used for a lot of things.
[Kojiroh] It's the desk with the terminal.
[Kojiroh] The terminal is on the desk.
[Kojiroh] I don't need to use it right now.
　Go outside
[Kojiroh] Yeah, let's step outside.
a002
[Kojiroh] I should warn Purin.
[Kojiroh] Yeah...
[Kojiroh] I need to warn Purin.
[Kojiroh] I don't mind you cleaning the room but...

[Akane] Hey Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Akane] Hey Kojiroh!
[Kojiroh] Yeah...?
[Akane] Were you daydreaming again?
[Kojiroh] Oh...
[Akane] What about Kou?
[Kojiroh] No, nothing... Oh yeah...
[Akane] What?
[Kojiroh] How do you know Kou?
[Akane] Oh, I met him at an interview once.
[Kojiroh] Oh, really...
[Kojiroh] (She's lying...)
[Kojiroh] (But why? Why does she need to lie?)
[Akane] So what do you think about this case?
[Kojiroh] Why do you wanna know?
[Kojiroh] Well, I just thought that I might be able\to help. I mean... There's that 50 you know...
[Kojiroh] Yeah, yeah...
[Akane] By the way, I need to use your phone.\Thanks.
[Kojiroh] Hey, wait...
001
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Something's not right...)
[Kojiroh] (There's something not right... I just\don't know what it is...)
[Kojiroh] (But I know that something's not right.)
[Akane] What the...!
[Purin] I can't believe you!
[Akane] Ouch! Hold on a sec!
[Purin] I can't believe you!
[Kojiroh] What's wrong?
b16
[Akane] What the hell's her problem?
[Kojiroh] What happened?
[Akane] I went to make a phone call and all of a\sudden, this girl starts hitting me.
[Purin] How dare you!
[Akane] I'm gonna take off... Okay?
[Kojiroh] Wait...
001
[Kojiroh] What the hell's going on...?
b03
b03b
[Kojiroh] What happened?
[Purin] Oh Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Could you explain what just happened...?
[Purin] I'm so sorry...
[Kojiroh] You don't need to apologize...
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] Could you just tell me what happened?
[Purin] Okay... But I'm so sorry...
[Kojiroh] I told you, you don't need to\apologize... What happened?
[Purin] She walked over the holy ground.
[Kojiroh] The holy ground?
[Purin] She walked over toward Mecca.
[Kojiroh] Oh, I see... Mecca...
[Purin] Yes...
[Kojiroh] You're Muslim... That's why?
[Purin] Yes...
[Kojiroh] I thought you're not supposed to show any\part of your body.
[Purin] That's the old way. Muslims have\advanced...
[Kojiroh] Oh... Okay...
[Purin] I'm so sorry... I just got upset...
[Kojiroh] Don't worry about it.
[Purin] I shouldn't have acted the way I did... She\didn't know...
[Kojiroh] I'll just tell her about it later...
b03
[Purin] Thank you.
[Kojiroh] By the way.
[Purin] Yes?
[Kojiroh] Which way is Mecca directed?
[Purin] Well...
[Kojiroh] You know, I don't want to be yelled at...
[Purin] It's the left corner.
[Kojiroh] Okay.
[Kojiroh] (Whew...)
[Kojiroh] (Muslims are Islamic followers...)
[Kojiroh] (Islam...)
[Kojiroh] (Wait a minute...)
[Purin] I'm going to finish the laundry, okay?
[Kojiroh] Wha... What?
[Purin] They were piled up...
001
Purin leaves.
[Akane] Anything else?
[Kojiroh] You still want a present?
[Akane] No, your investigation.
[Kojiroh] Well... I need to check out the scene of\the crime.
[Akane] Oh...
[Kojiroh] Every investigation starts from the scene\of the crime, I say.
[Akane] Yeah, yeah.
[Kojiroh] Well... I don't have proof that the\painting was stolen from that house...
[Akane] You mean, Kou?
[Kojiroh] Yeah.
[Kojiroh] (Yeah, that would make sense...)
[Kojiroh] (I can't be sure that the painting was\stolen from that house...)
[Kojiroh] (I really need to check out that house\once more.)
[Akane] So anything else?
[Kojiroh] Nope.
[Akane] Nothing?
[Kojiroh] Do you understand English? I said, "No."
[Akane] You know, you need to get with it.
[Kojiroh] I am.
[Akane] And so far, you have nothing?
[Kojiroh] That's right.
[Akane] Come on... You must have SOMETHING?
[Kojiroh] Well... It's only a hunch, but I don't\think the painting was stolen.
[Akane] So you don't think it was a burglary?
[Kojiroh] But someone's trying to make it look that\way...
[Akane] Who?
[Kojiroh] I don't know.
[Akane] Katsuragi Offices have a different opinion.
[Kojiroh] Yayoi and I agreed on this... It's just\Fido who has a different opinion.
[Akane] Fido?
[Kojiroh] Yeah, Dildo. Nikaido. Fido. Whatever...
[Akane] Oh, him.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, he's working on the scene... And\he's stubborn.
[Akane] So if Yayoi and you have the same\thoughts... Then that's probably most likely,\right?
[Kojiroh] You're jotting this down?
[Akane] Yeah... It's the small things like this\that make the front page.
[Kojiroh] Oh...
[Akane] Well... That's about it for now... Let's\say 50 plus present then...
[Kojiroh] And what's that 50 plus present?
[Akane] It's a 50 plus present.
[Kojiroh] Isn't it your birthday today?
[Akane] Wow... I'm impressed.
[Kojiroh] How about a toothbrush?
[Akane] You know... I won't ask for a pricey\present... But there needs to be love.
[Kojiroh] (What does she know about love...)
[Akane] Did you say something?
[Kojiroh] No, nothing.
[Akane] Well, I don't want to get between you and\that girl so...
[Kojiroh] What are you talking about?
[Akane] Oh, don't worry. I can keep a secret.
[Kojiroh] First of all, she's already 18. Second,\there's nothing between us.
[Akane] Right. You guys just take baths together.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Akane] And he doesn't even feel guilty...
[Kojiroh] Did you say something?
[Akane] No, nothing.
[Kojiroh] And?
[Akane] And?
[Kojiroh] What did you want?
[Akane] How's that case turning out?
[Kojiroh] There's nothing much going on.
[Akane] You're lying...
[Kojiroh] Why should I tell you anything in the\first place?
[Akane] Oh, come on. You wouldn't have this client\if it wasn't for me.
[Kojiroh] So what?
[Akane] Yayoi seemed interested in you... She\wanted to know more about you...
[Kojiroh] So what would you like to know.
[Akane] That's the spirit!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Akane] So?
[Kojiroh] So what?
[Akane] Explain.
[Kojiroh] None.
[Akane] Well then, I guess tomorrow's headline's\set.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Akane] "Private Investigator Kojiroh's Affair with\a Young Girl"
[Kojiroh] I told you... There's nothing between us!
[Akane] Yeah right.
[Kojiroh] Listen, I really haven't done anything. I\haven't even laid my fingers on her yet.
[Purin] Kojiroh, where did you put your clothes\when we took a bath last night?
[Kojiroh] That's right, we only took a bath\together.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] It's just a misunderstanding!
[Akane] You did take a bath together, right?
[Kojiroh] It was an accident.
[Akane] Like anyone's gonna buy that.
[Kojiroh] It's not what you think.
[Akane] I thought you'd be more interested in older\women.
[Kojiroh] It's true!
[Akane] Oh, really!?
[Kojiroh] No, no. The part about me liking older\women is true! Oh, never mind...
[Akane] So you admit it.
[Kojiroh] NO!
　Surroundings
　Akane
　Camera
[Kojiroh] I really don't have time for this...
[Akane] But you do have the time for that girl...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] What are you, a bloodhound?
[Kojiroh] You sure do come at the right time.
[Akane] Oh, don't call me a bloodhound... I'm so\much cuter!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Did you say something, Ms. Bloodhound?
[Akane] Oh, come on...
[Kojiroh] You're like a hungry dog, you know that?
[Kojiroh] You always come at a bad time.
[Akane] Well, it's a good time for me.
[Akane] You can't have it.
[Kojiroh] I don't want it.
[Kojiroh] It will be a mess if you take a picture\of Purin and I... And take it to Yayoi...
[Akane] Hey, there's an idea.
[Kojiroh] That's invasion of privacy!
[Akane] Yeah, yeah...
　Go outside
[Kojiroh] Fine, what do you want?
[Akane] Hold on a sec. I'm not done talking.
[Kojiroh] Don't worry, I am.
[Akane] Well, I'm not. Okay!?
[Kojiroh] Okay, then let's just say that we have a\little to talk about.
[Akane] Huh?

　Move
　Speak
　Eat
　Food
[Kojiroh] I ate already.
[Kojiroh] Isn't there something you wanna tell her?
[Kojiroh] But man... I didn't know we had all this\food.
[Purin] I wanted a variety...
[Kojiroh] When did you go shopping?
[Purin] Some of them weren't that fresh, but they\were still edible. Others, I just threw away.
I dig in.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, I guess the pork was still edible,\huh?
0060d
eve_52
Ah!
[Purin] ...What did you just say?
[Kojiroh] I said, "...Still edible, huh?"
[Purin] No, before that.
[Kojiroh] Pork?
eve_52
Yech!
eve_23
[Purin] Spit it out!
[Kojiroh] What? What?
[Purin] That dish is poisoned!
[Kojiroh] Poisoned!?
I spit everything out.
[Purin] Hurry!
[Kojiroh] What!?
[Purin] Spit it out!
[Kojiroh] DAMMIT! (Don't stick your finger in my\mouth!)
[Purin] I don't care if you have to throw up on\these clothes, just spit it out!
[Kojiroh] (Those are my clothes!)
[Purin] You need to spit it out... Or the poison...
[Kojiroh] (What poison!?)
[Purin] I'm sorry but...!
[Kojiroh] Wait...!?
Purin throws a clean hit in my abdominal area.
[Kojiroh] OHHHH!
[Purin] Come on... Throw it all up!
[Kojiroh] What are you doing!?
[Purin] Here, let me...
[Kojiroh] NO, wait!
Purin throws another nice punch to the body.
[Kojiroh] @$#*#@!@!
[Purin] Now you're okay...
[Kojiroh] I... I don't... Think so...
001
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Man... What the hell happened?
[Purin] Don't worry... I took care of everything.
b03
[Kojiroh] Do you have something against me, or\what!?
[Purin] No, it's not that... I was just trying to\help you...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] From evil...
[Kojiroh] Evil...?
[Purin] Yes...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Maybe she's not feeling well...)
[Purin] Pigs are evil. If you eat pigs, you'll die.
[Kojiroh] Pigs?
[Purin] Yes... They are evil...
[Kojiroh] (Okay, maybe she's REALLY not feeling\well...)
[Purin] I'm so... Sorry...
[Kojiroh] It's okay... I guess it's not my problem\if you're a wacko...
[Purin] Thank you.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] Would you like more?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] It's pretty good...
[Purin] Thank you. But I'm still in the process of\learning.
[Kojiroh] Learning?
[Purin] Yes. This is what I do.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (I guess she's an assistant chef, or\something.)
I dig in.
Purin smiles as she sees me diggin' in.
[Kojiroh] Hey, you know... Your eyes...
[Purin] Yes?
[Kojiroh] Your eyes are different colors.
[Purin] Yes.
[Kojiroh] The left one's blue, but the right one is\gold.
[Purin] Yes... People sometimes stare at me...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] Is it so unusual to have different colored\eyes in this country?
[Kojiroh] Not really.... I don't think so.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Oops... I guess it is rude to stare at\someone...)
[Kojiroh] (Maybe she has some kind of a inferiority\complex or something.)
[Purin] Well... Come on... You need to eat more.
[Kojiroh] ... Oh yeah...
[Purin] Come to the table, let's eat.
[Kojiroh] Alright.
0060
0060b
[Kojiroh] Wow... That's a lot for breakfast...
[Purin] Go ahead, dig in.
[Kojiroh] Thanks, I will.
I dig into the food.
[Purin] How is it?
[Kojiroh] It's pretty good.
Purin blushes...
[Kojiroh] Did you really make this?
[Purin] Yes.
I stuff my mouth with more food.
[Purin] I think Mr. Vegetables and Mr. Cow are\happy knowing that someone is enjoying them.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (I'm starting to lose my appetite...)
　Purin
[Kojiroh] Oh man...
[Purin] I'm really good at housekeeping.
[Kojiroh] Housekeeping, huh?
[Purin] Then won't you consider this?
[Kojiroh] What?
[Purin] You can hire me.
[Kojiroh] Hire you?
[Purin] I don't feel good knowing that I'm staying\here for free... But if I can do your housekeeping\then...
[Kojiroh] I see...
[Purin] I can keep your place neat and tight.
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Purin] Please?
[Kojiroh] Well...
[Purin] I'll do anything.
[Kojiroh] Okay, but first...
[Purin] Yes?
[Kojiroh] Check with your guardian first, okay?
[Purin] Okay.
[Kojiroh] Only then, you can stay. Understand?
[Purin] Perfectly.
[Kojiroh] And this is only temporary.
b03
eve_16
[Purin] Thank you... I'll work really hard!
[Kojiroh] Now that we got that settled...
[Purin] Wash the dishes, right? I'm on my way!
001
[Purin] You won't regret this.
[Kojiroh] (I hope not...)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Well, what the hell was I supposed to do?
[Kojiroh] She doesn't have parents and she's got\nowhere to go... I can't just kick her out into the\streets.
[Kojiroh] And she seems to be in some kind of\trouble...
[Kojiroh] Oh well...
[Kojiroh] It's only for a few days...
[Kojiroh] Maybe that'll be enough time for her to\think and move on.
[Kojiroh] Man...
Ding, dong.
[Kojiroh] I got a bad feeling about this.
[Voice] Hey you! You don't look so hot... What's\wrong?
b16
[Kojiroh] Oh, it's you... Didn't I tell you to wait\until someone opens the door?
[Akane] Yeah, but the door was open.
[Kojiroh] Oh, so I guess if the boys' bathroom door\was open, you'd walk straight in, eh?
[Akane] That's a bit different, don't you think?
[Kojiroh] Yeah, yeah.
[Akane] There you go again, that face.
[Kojiroh] Oh, shut up...
[Akane] Come on, brighten up a little.
[Purin] Kojiroh...
001
b03
[Akane] ...
[Purin] Where should I put the recyclable trash?
[Kojiroh] Just toss it in with the other trash.
[Purin] No... You should separate them.
[Kojiroh] Fine... You take care of it,\smarty-pants.
[Purin] Okay.
[Akane] Hey, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] What?
[Akane] Who is this girl?
[Purin] My name is Purin. I'm a housekeeper here\and I just started today.
[Akane] A housekeeper?
[Kojiroh] Never mind... Just go separate the\trash...
[Purin] Okay.
001
b16
[Kojiroh] ...
[Akane] Kojiroh!
[Kojiroh] I know what you're going to say... Just\don't say it.
[Akane] How can I not!?
[Kojiroh] Just keep your trap shut.
[Akane] No way.
[Kojiroh] ...Now you listen to me, vermin.
[Akane] Who the hell is she? Why does she have your\clothes on... And a housekeeper? I think you'd\better explain.
[Kojiroh] There's nothing to explain.
[Akane] Excuse me?
eve_03
[Kojiroh] So you do have a guardian?
[Purin] Yes.
[Kojiroh] Anyway, your clothes are in the laundry\basket...
[Purin] Oh, please. I'll do anything.
[Kojiroh] I said no. You want me to break the law?
[Purin] No, but...
[Kojiroh] You're just...
Purin starts sobbing...
b03b
eve_17
[Kojiroh] Oh, stop your whining. That's not gonna\work on me...
[Purin] But... I have nowhere to go...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] Really... I have nowhere to go...
[Kojiroh] (Oh, man...)
[Purin] I was so scared when those people\surrounded me in the dark...
[Kojiroh] (Ah, for cryin' out loud...)
[Purin] I was so relieved when you rescued me...\And you also saw me naked...
[Kojiroh] THAT was an accident.
[Purin] Where do I go from here...?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] Where did you live until now?
[Purin] I... Can't go back...
[Kojiroh] No, no. I don't want any trouble\whatsoever.
[Purin] Oh, please... I'll do anything.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Man... What the hell am I supposed to\do...)
[Kojiroh] (She seems to be in some kind of trouble,\but...)
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] Where are your parents?
[Purin] They... Passed away...
[Kojiroh] Oh... I'm sorry.
[Purin] It's okay.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] So, do you have a guardian?
[Purin] Yes.
[Kojiroh] (Oh...)
[Kojiroh] Then let's continue...
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] I'm stuffed.
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] I'm not gonna ask for your nationality,\where you came from, or what your personal\situation is... But...
[Kojiroh] You look about eighteen.
[Purin] Yes...
[Kojiroh] So go home to your parents.
[Purin] ...
[Purin] Um...
[Kojiroh] Nope.
[Purin] I can't stay?
[Kojiroh] No, no, no.
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] I can't just let you stay here...
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] That would be like... Kidnapping.
[Purin] Kidnapping?
[Kojiroh] Yeah, I can't just take in some kid\without the parent's permission.
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] I can get my business license revoked.
[Purin] But... I'm eighteen...
[Kojiroh] Eighteen!?
[Purin] Yes.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Damn, she looks really young...)
[Kojiroh] (Now that I think about it... She did\look pretty developed...)
[Kojiroh] See, I'm eating.
[Purin] You can have as much as you want.
[Kojiroh] So... Purin, may I call you Purin...?
[Purin] Yes, but I'm not made of gellatin...
[Kojiroh] ... Okay.
[Purin] Thank you.
[Kojiroh] When you finish eating, go home, okay?
0060c
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] Okay?
[Purin] After I finish eating, right?
[Kojiroh] Right...
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] (Damn, her eyes...)
[Kojiroh] (They're so... Intoxicating.)
[Kojiroh] Well, okay. Let's put it off until we\finish eating.
I gobble down my food.
[Kojiroh] This is great!
0060
0060b
[Purin] Thank you.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (This is so bizarre...)
[Purin] Come on. The food's getting cold.
[Kojiroh] Okay.
[Purin] Your food is getting cold...
[Kojiroh] I don't care.
b03b
[Purin] But...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] But I tried really hard...
[Kojiroh] I know...
[Purin] The poor cows and vegetables...
[Kojiroh] Excuse me...?
[Purin] If you don't eat them while they're good...\Then their deaths were in vain.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] You have to eat them while they're good and\hot, or their deaths would be in vain.
[Kojiroh] (What the hell is this girl talking\about...?)
[Purin] I... I...
[Kojiroh] ... Let's just eat first.
b03
[Purin] Okay.. Then have a seat.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (And I thought she was going to cry on\me...)
[Kojiroh] (What the hell am I supposed to do with\her?)
[Kojiroh] So...
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] (This is good... What a conversation...)
Purin is just sitting there, waiting for me to say something.
[Kojiroh] How are you?
[Purin] Fine, thank you.
[Kojiroh] It's a great day... Don't you think?
[Purin] Yes... It is.
[Kojiroh] Never mind...
[Kojiroh] You said your name is Purin, right?
[Purin] Right.
[Kojiroh] Is that your real name?
[Purin] Yes.
[Kojiroh] Then your mother's name must be Ice\Cream...
[Purin] I like your sense of humor.
[Kojiroh] You like it?
[Purin] Yes.
[Kojiroh] I'm a pretty funny guy, you know.
[Purin] Yes.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] What is it?
[Kojiroh] Is Purin really your name?
[Purin] Yes.
[Kojiroh] Oh, okay.
[Purin] I... Like you.

　Food
[Kojiroh] The food's pretty good.
[Kojiroh] It's not gourmet, but it ain't half bad.
[Kojiroh] And I thought there was hardly anything\in the fridge... How resourceful!
[Kojiroh] You're showing some potential.
[Purin] Thank you very much!
[Kojiroh] And now, thanks to you, my place smells\as sweet as this food.
[Kojiroh] This hardboiled world of mine...
[Kojiroh] Thanks to your cooking, this place smells\a lot nicer...
[Kojiroh] Uh-oh... I can feel my stomach going to\work...
[Purin] Please help yourself to as much as you\like.
[Kojiroh] (When I look at her, I sense something\very...unsettling.)
[Kojiroh] (Hmm...)
[Kojiroh] (There's just this...indecency about\her...)
[Kojiroh] (It's no surprise she was wandering\around this wharf alone at night.)
[Kojiroh] (She claims she has nowhere to stay... I\wonder.)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Perhaps she's one of those illegal\immigrant workers...)
[Kojiroh] (I wonder if she got in trouble with her\boss...)
[Kojiroh] (She's young and doesn't appear to be\very strong...)
[Kojiroh] (I don't even want to think about what\kind of work she was doing.)
[Kojiroh] (She's an 18 year old fox.)
[Kojiroh] (I never imagined I'd run into a\situation like this.)
[Kojiroh] (I shouldn't get involved with this...)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] You're not an average teen-ager.
[Kojiroh] I know she's a foreigner, but why did she\cook here?
[Kojiroh] But even so, her skin is so...
