[Kojiroh] I'm back in my office...
[Kojiroh] I wonder if Purin is back yet.

eve_23
[Purin] Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Yep. She's back.
[Purin] I've made the arrangements. Would you like\dinner first, or a bath?
[Kojiroh] Stop talking like we're newlyweds...
[Purin] I never meant... Please, don't\misunderstand...
[Kojiroh] Then why are you fidgeting so much?\Jesus...
[Purin] Please... Dinner, or a bath?
[Kojiroh] Dinner.
[Purin] Yes sir! Wait at the table while I serve\you.
001
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] You seem much less nervous than usual.\What's going on?
[Kojiroh] You aren't getting too familiar with this\place, are you?
[Kojiroh] Oh, well...
0060
0060b
[Purin] Dinner is served!
[Kojiroh] Looks scrumptious.
[Purin] Dig in, please.
I stuff my face.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (After gobbling down food so fast, I like\a little something special.)
[Kojiroh] (She's not bad... Not bad at all.)
[Kojiroh] (A true pro like me deserves to have\meals made for him...)
[Kojiroh] (One of these days I won't be able to eat\like this...)
[Kojiroh] (Eat whenever you can, sleep whenever you\can. I live by those principles.)
I swallow as much as I can.
Purin giggles.
[Kojiroh] What's so funny?
[Purin] It's every woman's dream to watch a man\indulge in her food. I'm so happy.
Clash...
[Purin] Uh-oh... The fork fell from your plate.
[Kojiroh] Every woman's dream, eh?
[Purin] What's the matter? You aren't eating.
[Kojiroh] Obviously...
[Purin] There's plenty more on the stove... Eat as\much as you can.
[Kojiroh] Mmm...
I continue eating like a hog.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (I love it when she stares at me with\those eyes of hers...)
[Kojiroh] (It's like...she's breathing me in...)
I stuff my mouth full of food.
Clash.
[Kojiroh] I'm done...
[Purin] How is it?
[Kojiroh] Good. I'm done. Ready for bath.
[Purin] Very well, then. I've prepared your\bathwater and towels.
[Kojiroh] Jesus...
[Kojiroh] (She sure knows her way around this\place...)
[Purin] Shall I get you anything else?
[Kojiroh] No thanks... I'll be in the bath.
[Purin] Please put your dirty clothes in the basket\on the left. Your change of clothes is in the\basket on the right.
[Kojiroh] ...For cryin' out loud, woman!
[Purin] Yes?
[Kojiroh] Nothing.
I turn on the shower.
It pours over my tired muscles.
I wash my body...
[Kojiroh] (This feels quite good... The temperature\is just right.)
[Kojiroh] (But shit, man... I shouldn't let her get\so acquainted with this place.)
I scrub my body... All over.
[Kojiroh] (I'll have to build a wall around my\office if this keeps up.)
[Kojiroh] (This ain't good...)
[Kojiroh] (She does whatever I wish...)
I scrub behind my ears...
[Kojiroh] Now I'll just rinse off my body.
Oh yeah, that feels good...
[Kojiroh] And now for the bath!
0170
Splash!
[Kojiroh] Oh, yeah...
[Kojiroh] I can feel the filth and fatigue drain\from my body.
[Kojiroh] This hits the spot!
[Kojiroh] Moments like these make the world go\around.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] But what will Purin do from now on...?
[Kojiroh] She must have a guardian somewhere. She\can't stay here forever.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] But, then again...
[Kojiroh] She's a nice girl... That's the main\problem.
[Kojiroh] I'm well aware of the possibility that I\may have feelings for her.
[Kojiroh] I can't let that happen... She can't go\on spoiling me like this.
[Kojiroh] This is good reasoning, but emotion has\been known to overthrow reasoning.
[Kojiroh] Hmmm...
[Kojiroh] She sure is a nice girl...
The shower door opens.
[Kojiroh] Purin?? I've already prepared my change\of clothes.
[Purin] Excuse me, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] What the hell?!?
0170b
[Kojiroh] Ah!
[Purin] Shall I get you some hot water?
[Kojiroh] Ahhh!
[Purin] Is it too hot? Let me change it for you...
[Kojiroh] What the heck are you thinking!?!
[Purin] Allow me to wash your back.
[Kojiroh] What, are you crazy?!? Have you lost your\damned mind?!?
Squish.
Ohhh!...
\　
[Purin] Are you alright? I heard a terrible\sound...
[Kojiroh] I slammed my head against the wall... I'm\a bit dizzy.
[Purin] Sit down, and do it slowly.
[Kojiroh] Okay... No, dammit! What's going on!
[Purin] What's wrong?
[Kojiroh] What ever happened to obeying the Islamic\commandments!?!
[Purin] Allah teaches all men and women to express\their love for one another to the fullest extent.
[Kojiroh] This isn't what he had in mind!
[Purin] There's no reason to be embarrassed. We're\already naked together.
[Kojiroh] You're not listening to what I'm\saying...
[Purin] Stay still and let me wash your back.
[Kojiroh] No!
[Purin] Now it's my turn to enter the tub...
[Kojiroh] No way! No, Goddammit!
[Purin] It's okay... I don't mind at all.
[Kojiroh] I mind! Now's not a good time!
[Purin] Why are you holding the towel over your\waist?
[Kojiroh] You never mind that!
[Purin] Ah!
[Kojiroh] Look out!
0180
Smash!
[Purin] OH!
[Kojiroh] Ohh...
[Purin] Sorry... Oh, my legs and arms are tied up.
[Kojiroh] Geez...
[Purin] Don't move your face yet... It tickles!
[Kojiroh] Ohh...
[Purin] I need to make the preparations... Oh!
[Kojiroh] Oomph...
[Purin] Lift your legs up here, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] Mmm...
[Purin] Pull your legs over here... There you go...
[Kojiroh] Oh...
[Purin] Now then... Huh? Kojiroh!
[Kojiroh] ...!
[Purin] What happened, Kojiroh?
[Kojiroh] Mmmm...!
[Purin] Oh my... Kojiroh?
[Kojiroh] Geez...
[Purin] Hey, Kojiroh!?!

eve_02
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Whew...
[Kojiroh] Damn, I didn't get to slip it in...
[Kojiroh] But, I almost came... Nah...
[Kojiroh] I'm not so excited about her as I used to\be.
[Kojiroh] I wonder why she doesn't appear\ashamed... Does she like this stuff?
[Kojiroh] ...But it made me feel kinda happy.
[Kojiroh] I mean, shit... Her pussy was right in my\face.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Oh, the temptation!
[Kojiroh] That foxy mama sure is built...
[Kojiroh] I didn't notice it yesterday, but now I\can see she's got one hell of a body...
[Kojiroh] She's got the face of a child, but the\body of a WOMAN.
[Kojiroh] The Viagra came in handy.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] What am I saying!?!
[Kojiroh] I'm the head of the Amagi Private\Detective Office... I've got to act dignified.
[Kojiroh] I've got to be strict!
[Kojiroh] Hey, Purin!
Purin snores away...
I bend down.
0040
Purin sleeps deeply...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Oh, well... Tomorrow, I'll tell her to\control herself.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] She looks so cute when she sleeps...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I shouldn't be staring at her like\this...
[Kojiroh] Shit... I can't even control myself! She\makes me so hard!

[Kojiroh] I wonder if Purin is back yet...
[Kojiroh] She doesn't seem like the type of girl to\suddenly get homesick.
[Kojiroh] I am worried about her...
The phone rings.
[Kojiroh] Maybe it's Purin.
It rings again.
I pick up.
eve_26
[Kojiroh] Hello, this is---
[Voice] Hello there, Mr. Amagi.
[Kojiroh] May I ask who this is?
[Voice] My name is Kou.
[Kojiroh] Oh, hi... How did your wife's third\anniversary go?
[Voice] Listen to me... Over in your place is...
Click.
The phone line goes dead. He must've hung up.
[Kojiroh] Weird...
[Kojiroh] He didn't even finish his sentence...
[Kojiroh] And his voice was strange... I wonder\what happened.
[Kojiroh] What was he trying to tell me?

[Kojiroh] That's strange... Purin isn't back yet.
[Kojiroh] And it's getting late...
[Kojiroh] Maybe those bastards are screwing with\her again...
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] Shit. I get crazy when she's around, and\I get worried when she's gone...
[Kojiroh] If she went grocery shopping, she'd be on\Central Avenue.

[Kojiroh] I'm back at the detective office.

[Kojiroh] Whew... I'm finally back at the office.

eve_59
[Kojiroh] The light is on...
[Kojiroh] Luckily this is good security. It blinks\whenever someone other than me uses the terminal.
[Kojiroh] Which means... Ah! Someone used the\terminal!
0290
eve_10
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] It's still a little warm.
[Kojiroh] Someone must've used it just a few\minutes ago.
I turn the switch on.
It spurts out sounds...
[Kojiroh] Come on, dammit...
[Kojiroh] There's nothing unusual with the data...
[Kojiroh] Basically, someone used it. At least my\information is still here.
[Kojiroh] I'd be in big trouble if they initialized\the internal hard-disk.
The terminal sputters about...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Good. Everything's here like it was\before.
001
[Kojiroh] I hope no one screwed with it.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] But who could've done it?
[Kojiroh] Purin!?!?2
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Nah, she'd never do this kind of thing.
[Kojiroh] I told her not to meddle in my affairs...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I'm losing it... I'm an investigator...\Don't judge things with emotion, use logic.
[Kojiroh] Why am I trusting some broad I just met\last night?
[Kojiroh] I don't know anything about her.

[Purin] Oh, Kojiroh... Welcome home.
[Purin] I'll get dinner ready in just a second.

She dashes away.
[Kojiroh] Oh, no... She's getting too familiar with\this place.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Why did I come back? Glen's waiting for\me.
001
b03
[Purin] You must've had so much fun...
[Kojiroh] I guess you could say that...
[Purin] But, you didn't swim, Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] I can't swim... Don't mind.
[Purin] Well then, I'll get dinner ready.
[Kojiroh] Great.
001
She dashes off to begin cooking.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Hmm... She's a bit too familiar with this\place.
[Kojiroh] This could be a problem.
eve_03
The phone rings.
[Kojiroh] I'll get it...
[Purin] No, let me...
[Kojiroh] Thanks, but no thanks. I'll get it.
I pick up the receiver.
[Kojiroh] Amagi Private Detective Office here...
[Voice] It's me...
[Kojiroh] Glen?
[Glen] Yeah.
[Kojiroh] What's up?
[Glen] I've got some news about that painting.
[Kojiroh] I heard it was---.
[Glen] Ha ha ha... I know all about it.
[Kojiroh] Oh, you've already heard? News travels\fast...
[Glen] It's my job to get information faster than\anyone else...
[Kojiroh] If you know the info, you should know\what I'm about to say...
[Glen] Hey, don't overdo yourself... Just listen to\what I have to say. You may learn something.
[Kojiroh] Well, you're Speaking with confidence.
[Glen] Yes...
[Kojiroh] Okay. Same place as before?
[Glen] Yeah.
[Kojiroh] I'll be there in a few minutes. Can you\make it?
[Glen] I'm actually there right now...
[Kojiroh] Jesus... Why didn't you just say that in\the first place.
[Glen] There's no need to get upset.
[Kojiroh] Hmm... Fine. I'll be there in a little\while.

[Kojiroh] Huh...?
[Kojiroh] What the hell is this!?!
[Purin] Welcome home, Kojiroh.
b03
[Kojiroh] This is a strange sight...
[Purin] Your laundry is finished drying.
[Kojiroh] I have a dryer, you know! What the hell's\a client gonna think when they come!?!
[Purin] Oh... I apologize... I thought a clothes\dryer might damage this fabric...
[Kojiroh] Is my office any place to dry clothing!?!
[Purin] I'm sorry! I'll take it down!
001
001b
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] It may not be a beautiful office, but at\least there's no laundry hanging around.
[Kojiroh] This place is starting to look like a\boarding house...
[Kojiroh] It makes a guy want to cry.

[Purin] Oh, I put your laundry in the dryer.
[Kojiroh] I'm really sorry for scolding you before.\I tried... What the hell?!?
[Purin] Pardon me?
[Kojiroh] Where is my money that was on the table?
[Purin] Oh, that?
[Kojiroh] And what the hell are these receipts?
[Purin] Oh, Those are...
The phone rings.
[Kojiroh] Damn.
[Purin] It's the telephone...
001
Purin rushes to answer the phone.
[Kojiroh] Hey!
She picks up the phone.
[Purin] Hello, this is... Oh, hi!
[Kojiroh] What the...?
[Purin] Yes, of course...
[Kojiroh] (Why the hell is there a phone call for\her at this office?)
[Purin] Yes. Hold on, please.
b03
[Purin] The telephone's for you, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] For me...?
[Purin] Yes.
[Kojiroh] (Who could it be...?)
[Kojiroh] This is Amagi...
[Voice] This is the landlord of the warehouse.
[Kojiroh] Sorry about the rent, but...
[Voice] You've failed to pay the rent for the last\3 months, but your debts have been cleared.
[Kojiroh] What!?!
[Voice] You barely made it. If you hadn't paid\today you would've been evicted.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Voice] We gave the receipts to your wife. Thank\you.
Click.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] You've got some explaining to do.
[Purin] I do?
[Kojiroh] What the hell's going on around here...
b03b
[Purin] Well, umm...
[Kojiroh] I'm listening.
[Purin] Well, apparently your rent debt was growing\quite high.
[Kojiroh] You'd better mind your own business.
[Purin] But... You'd have been evicted if I hadn't\paid them.
[Kojiroh] I said mind your own business. This place\is none of your concern.
[Purin] Sorry...
[Kojiroh] And what's this business about you being\my wife...?
[Purin] They'd never have given me the receipts if\I didn't tell them we were married.
[Kojiroh] How the heck could rent have cost so\much!?!
[Purin] But... We were out of food. I had to go\shopping as well...
[Kojiroh] What else did you buy!?!
[Purin] When I paid the landlord, I decided to pay\the next few months in advance.
[Kojiroh] Goddammit! I'm broke!
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] What the hell am I supposed to do now!?!
[Purin] I... I just wanted to...help you...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] Sorry... I just wanted to...
[Kojiroh] (I'm the one who should be crying...)
[Purin] I'm so sorry... I've only been in the way.\First the laundry, and now the money... You must\hate me...
[Kojiroh] Hey, don't cry...
She balls her eyes out.
[Kojiroh] I overreacted... It's no big deal,\really. I was too hard on you.
[Purin] You mean it...?
[Kojiroh] Thanks to you, I won't be evicted... I\owe you one.
[Purin] Oh, thank you, Kojiroh... Oh! I must tidy\up the laundry.

[Kojiroh] I know as little as you do about this\situation, sweetheart.
[Akane] Why was Nikaido put on the murderer list\then?
[Kojiroh] Uhh, because he murdered someone,\perhaps?
[Akane] Kojiroh!
[Kojiroh] Don't wet your pants. I don't know\anything about it.
[Akane] Ohh...
[Kojiroh] And stop moaning like a dog.
[Kojiroh] (Damn... I'd like to ask these questions\to someone.)
[Kojiroh] (He probably got startled and forgot to\wipe off his fingerprints.)
[Kojiroh] (God damn it... He's so stupid!)
[Akane] So, you don't know why Nikaido was put on\the most wanted list?
[Kojiroh] Must I repeat myself? Go read a newspaper\if you need to know so bad.
[Akane] I don't read newspapers! I already know\everything in every paper.
[Kojiroh] Well, there must be somewhere to satisfy\your needs.
[Akane] Katsuragi Private Detective Offices.
[Kojiroh] Yayoi's place?
[Akane] So now you're excited, eh?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (I ain't that excited.)
[Kojiroh] (They were in a bad fix and they just\received a knock out punch.)
[Kojiroh] (Nikaido's a fool...)
　Look/Investigate
　Move
　Speak
　Touch
　Tits
　Camera
[Kojiroh] (You never know what's written...)
[Kojiroh] (I'd better not...)
[Akane] Jesus... Do I have to prove to you that the\pen is stronger than any sword?
[Kojiroh] I won't do it anymore.
I touch her.
[Akane] Ahhh!
[Kojiroh] Hm... Small tits.
[Akane] You've got some nerve, sexually assaulting\a woman in broad daylight... Do it again and you'll\regret it!
[Kojiroh] Sorry, I was just fooling around.
[Kojiroh] I will never touch it. NEVER.
[Akane] Okay, Okay. $100 a touch.
[Kojiroh] No one is gonna touch it!
[Akane] It will break!
[Kojiroh] I am not some poisonous monster, you\know...
[Akane] Is that so?
[Kojiroh] ...You hurt my feeling a bit.
[Akane] It will rot!
[Kojiroh] Come on, now...
[Akane] It will stink!
[Kojiroh] Hey...
　Akane
[Kojiroh] Go read the paper. Maybe you'll find your\name in the credits.
[Akane] I'm too busy writing the news to read it!
[Kojiroh] You're talking like a pro...
[Akane] Well, I've been following a case of my\own...
[Kojiroh] A case of your own? I thought you were on\Kou's case.
[Akane] Oh! I almost forgot about my meeting with\the editor!
[Kojiroh] Huh?
[Akane] Bye! Pay me the introductory fee next time!
001
[Kojiroh] Great...
[Kojiroh] She's gone... What was that all about?
[Kojiroh] Following a case of her own?
[Kojiroh] Just what the hell is Akane up to?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Voice] Excuse me...
b03
[Purin] I've prepared some tea for you both.
[Kojiroh] She's gone. Gone with the wind.
[Purin] That's too bad... This is some delicious\tea.
[Kojiroh] There's no reason to make such delicious\tea for a dog like her.
[Purin] I see...
[Kojiroh] Ah, to hell with her...
[Purin] If you don't like her, than I don't like\her either!
[Kojiroh] Hey, you keep this up and I can almost\trust you with my accounting.
[Purin] Almost?
[Kojiroh] Why are looking at me like you're\expecting something?
[Purin] I am expecting something.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (I just may be digging my own grave.)
[Kojiroh] On that note, I think I'll go out for a\while.
[Purin] Hey, but... Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] If you need anything, ask me later on,\okay?
[Purin] ...Okay.

Purin leaves.
[Kojiroh] Oh, man... She's getting too close.
[Kojiroh] ...

[Akane] But, why?
[Kojiroh] What do you mean, "Why"??
[Akane] Didn't you get it from Kou?
[Kojiroh] Well, yeah...
[Akane] You didn't spend it all on a whore, did\you?
[Kojiroh] I may be perverted, but I'm not stupid. I\use my cash wisely.
[Akane] Maybe I'll go ask Kou myself.
[Kojiroh] Whatever throws your skirt up... Do what\you have to.
[Akane] I just saw him on Central Avenue, you know.
[Kojiroh] That's strange... He's probably in the\midst of looking for witnesses.
[Akane] Why is Kou looking for witnesses?
[Kojiroh] Wouldn't you, if someone died in your\house?
[Akane] What!
[Kojiroh] You mean, you didn't know about that?
[Akane] But... I haven't been reading the\newspaper, and I got so excited after hearing about\Nikaido... Wait a minute...
[Kojiroh] What?
[Akane] But...
[Kojiroh] What the hell's the matter with you?
[Akane] Why do you know all this...?
[Kojiroh] Know what?
[Akane] You aren't reading the newspaper, are you?\And you knew about Nikaido, didn't you?
[Kojiroh] Umm...umm...
[Kojiroh] (Shit. She might find out about last\night...)
[Kojiroh] (She lives to discover when, who, where,\why, and what happened with every damned thing she\comes in contact with.)
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah, Purin answered a phone-call from\Yayoi.
[Purin] Actually, I never answered the phone today.
[Kojiroh] I mean, While you were sleeping... Uh, go\and clean up the kitchen...
[Purin] Okay.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] So, where were we...
[Akane] This is interesting...
[Kojiroh] (Now I'm screwed.)
[Akane] I heard about it.
[Kojiroh] My measurements??
[Akane] Don't be foolish. I'm referring to the\painting you're looking for.
[Kojiroh] (Gulp.)
[Akane] So...
[Kojiroh] So...
[Akane] What's this?
[Kojiroh] Candy. Want some?
[Akane] I don't want this stuff!?!
[Kojiroh] Okay, that's too bad... Akane don't want\anything...
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] Don't look at me like that. I'll pay your\little introductory fee next time. Promise.
[Akane] You'd better.
[Kojiroh] Just as soon as I get another case...
[Akane] What! You were just paid!
[Kojiroh] I was, but I'm broke again.
[Akane] Ugh...
[Kojiroh] Moan all you want. It won't bring us any\cash... See? My pockets are empty.
[Akane] It's because of Purin, isn't it?
[Kojiroh] Huh?
[Akane] She has the money...?
[Kojiroh] (Bingo.) On what grounds do you say that?
[Akane] By the looks of this place, you'd be better\off with your wife in charge of the money.
001
[Kojiroh] Who said anything about a wife!?!
[Kojiroh] (If she takes the money, I won't be able\to survive!)
[Purin] Akane? What is it?
[Akane] Kojiroh owes me $5,000...
Purin slaps Akane's hand
[Akane] Ouch...
[Purin] I don't have it!
[Kojiroh] (Good going, Purin!)
b16
b16c
[Akane] Ouch... That hurt my hand...
[Kojiroh] See? Told you so...
[Akane] Fine! I'll give you some more time!
[Kojiroh] Comeback next lifetime... I just might\have it then.
[Akane] Did you say something?
[Kojiroh] Nope...
[Akane] Basically, you don't consider Nikaido to be\a killer.
[Kojiroh] You could say that.
[Akane] Isn't that what you're thinking?
[Kojiroh] Yeah, but I do think he's one sick\bastard.
[Akane] It is not following up...
[Kojiroh] I don't think he's got the guts to kill\anyone.
[Akane] But he's on the most wanted list...
[Kojiroh] He's a crucial witness, right? He hasn't\been convicted of anything yet.
[Akane] ...But then, why does he feel the need to\hide?
[Kojiroh] I don't know for sure, but perhaps...
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] Look, I'm just assuming that he didn't\kill anyone. I could be wrong.
[Akane] Then...
[Kojiroh] Well, Nikaiko probably knows that he's\just a suspect... But he also knows that he won't\be able to do anything during the investigation.
[Akane] But he's innocent, right?
[Kojiroh] At least I think so, but that's just me.\They said they have proof...
[Akane] So, what should I do?
[Kojiroh] What are you so confused for?
[Akane] Maybe you're right...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Akane] Maybe I am acting a little strange.

[Kojiroh] Can't you just be quiet for a change?
[Akane] Well explain it to me, then!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Akane] I'm not going anywhere until you explain it\to me!
[Kojiroh] Why do you want to know so much?
[Akane] What's wrong with just asking?
[Kojiroh] Why should I tell you?
[Akane] This camera is very important to me.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, yeah.
[Akane] You can't have it!
[Kojiroh] You asked me if I wanted it yesterday...
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] Who cares about her ribbon.
[Kojiroh] There're more important things at task.
[Kojiroh] I don't want it.
[Akane] You can't have it.
[Akane] You can't have it!
[Kojiroh] I don't need it.

[Akane] There's no way you can hide from me.
[Akane] There's no use in hiding! Tell me what's\going on!
[Kojiroh] Damn, woman... Don't you tell me what to\do!

[Kojiroh] Hmm...
I touch her.
[Purin] Mmm...
[Kojiroh] She's so soft...

[Kojiroh] No!

[Kojiroh] Damn... It's been 3 months since I've\been with a woman.

[Kojiroh] She's turning me on!
[Kojiroh] I wouldn't ordinarily be turned on by\such a young girl...

　About Kou
　About the curse
　About Kyoko
　About Nikaido
　About what to do next
[Kojiroh] Why would a killer be at Kou's place...?
[Kojiroh] I definitely didn't expect it...
[Kojiroh] I'd like to forget about it, but I have\to jog my memory a bit.
0150b
eve_13
[Kojiroh] Now it's all coming back to me...
[Kojiroh] Let's think this over a bit.
[Kojiroh] I don't know who it was, but a guy\wearing glasses was killed on Kou's sofa...
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] The police's probably going to handle it\as a murder.
[Kojiroh] His throat was slit with a survival\knife. How ironic...
s03
[Kojiroh] Now, about that knife...
[Kojiroh] It was lying behind the sofa.
0150b
[Kojiroh] When I found him, the cut was still\fresh.
[Kojiroh] I haven't heard the official autopsy, but\he was killed in the afternoon at the earliest.
[Kojiroh] The afternoon...
[Kojiroh] Hey, Kou wasn't there in the afternoon...
[Kojiroh] Which means, the killer was there when\Kou was out.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] But, why did the murder occur in Kou's\house? And why in the reception room?
[Kojiroh] What the hell went on there?
001
[Kojiroh] Hopefully it'll be in tomorrow's paper.
[Kojiroh] Shit, I don't have a subscription...
[Kojiroh] I'll go over to Yayoi's place. Maybe\she'll let me read it for free.
[Kojiroh] Hmm... This is the way things are with\me, lately.
[Kojiroh] The cops should be on it tonight... There\should be a police report available tomorrow.
[Kojiroh] Kou will obviously be called forth as a\witness...
[Kojiroh] I wonder how much information will be in\the paper.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I'm most interested in the last part of\the tape.
[Kojiroh] The line, "Listen to me... Over in your\place is..."
[Kojiroh] My place? What about my place?
[Kojiroh] What was he trying to tell me?
[Kojiroh] I'll listen to the tape, for now.
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah, right before that I got a phone\call from Kou.
[Kojiroh] But I can't remember what we talked\about...
[Kojiroh] He said something about a clue...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Hey, it should have been recorded on the\answering machine.
[Kojiroh] There's a recording function on the\answering machine. I always record my previous\phone call.
[Kojiroh] Then I record over it when someone else\calls.
[Kojiroh] No one called regarding a new case... His\conversation should still be there.
[Kojiroh] Simple common sense tells me that\coincidence can be a big help.
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] He wasn't killed by any curse. He was\killed by the hands of humanity.
[Kojiroh] That type of large knife is a typical\murder weapon.
[Kojiroh] And a lot of people have them.
[Kojiroh] In other words, it could just be a\coincidence.
[Kojiroh] But, then...
[Kojiroh] There's still something strange... I just\can't put my finger on it.
[Kojiroh] Okay, now I remember what it is.
[Kojiroh] Here's the sentence... I'd better take a\memo.
[Kojiroh] Okay, ready? Here goes...
[Kojiroh] It says, "To those who lay hands, their\punishment will be severe and thou shall suffer in\the fires of hell by God's blade..."
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] It could be a coincidence... But the\timing is just too perfect.
[Kojiroh] That's the anecdote surrounding the\painting...
[Kojiroh] And it fits right into this murder.
[Kojiroh] Maybe I should just wrap this up as a\coincidence.
[Kojiroh] She is doing some kind of an\investigation.
[Kojiroh] Being a student is just a cover.
[Kojiroh] She said she won't tell the police about\me.
[Kojiroh] I wonder if she kept her promise?
[Kojiroh] I hope men in dark suits aren't going to\barge into my place, tomorrow.
[Kojiroh] Maybe I should make a run for it, while I\can.
[Kojiroh] Kyoko Himuro... She was a weird one.
[Kojiroh] I guess being a student is just a cover.
[Kojiroh] She didn't jump when she saw the body,\and she's pretty sharp. Not a typical girl.
[Kojiroh] She said she was somekind of a public\servant.
[Kojiroh] I wonder what she does...
[Kojiroh] I hope she doesn't work for the IRS.
[Kojiroh] I hope he didn't leave any fingerprints\or anything.
[Kojiroh] He's such a idiot.
[Kojiroh] He came running out of Kou's house...
[Kojiroh] He probably panicked when he saw the\body.
[Kojiroh] He might be an idiot, but I don't think\he's a murderer...
[Kojiroh] I just hope he didn't leave any tracks\behind.
[Kojiroh] Well... If he did, I won't be able to\help him.
[Kojiroh] I don't know what he touched or did...
[Kojiroh] All I can do now is pray...
[Kojiroh] Yeah, it bugs me, but I'm a professional\investigator.
[Kojiroh] I only work for money... I don't do\anything that doesn't bring in money.
[Kojiroh] As long as I'm a pro...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I know... There's really something fishy\about this case...
[Kojiroh] But I can't do anything.
[Kojiroh] The words gonna get around that I beat\THE Katsuragi Private Detective Offices.
[Kojiroh] They're suppose to be best in the\business.
[Kojiroh] What a sad world... To be the top, you\have to bring someone down.
[Kojiroh] And it just happened to be Yayoi's.
[Kojiroh] I don't feel good doing it but... That's\business.
[Kojiroh] And I saw Yayoi and Nikaido...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] God! I don't even want to think about it.
[Kojiroh] I'm getting really blue here...
[Kojiroh] What am I gonna do now...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I solved the case, and got my money.
[Kojiroh] So Kou's no longer my client.
[Kojiroh] What the hell do I do now?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] The answer's obvious. I have to get\clients and solve cases to get paid.
[Kojiroh] Otherwise I'll starve to death.
[Kojiroh] Besides, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't\interested in the incident at Kou's place.
[Kojiroh] But what the hell can I do?
[Kojiroh] The cops are probably onto the case like\grease on a potsticker... There's no need for\anyone else.

[Kojiroh] Her name is Mayako Mido, and her father\works for the embassy...
[Kojiroh] Which means she can easily meet her\father.
[Kojiroh] So she doesn't live too far away.

[Kojiroh] I need something else... Another clue.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I remember now... She's a student at Yale\International School.
[Kojiroh] Now that I think about it, Eldia hires\people straight out of Yale.
[Kojiroh] Aha! I found it!
[Kojiroh] Hey, the embassy's not too far away from\Yale International School.

I hang up on her.
[Kojiroh] Damn... Mayako's father is the\Ambassador.
[Kojiroh] Hmm... Mido...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Didn't that Mido girl say her father\works at the embassy?
[Kojiroh] I wonder which embassy she was talking\about.
[Kojiroh] And her last name is Japanese...A\Japanese working in a embassy?
[Kojiroh] Maybe he just has a Japanese last name...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Or it could be that he works at an\embassy oversees. Then it would make sense.
[Kojiroh] Wait, no. She talked about it as if it\was around here.
[Kojiroh] It's probably in Japan somewhere and not\so far from here...
[Kojiroh] That would narrow it down a bit.

[Kojiroh] My Customized Glock 22... This here gun\is my main passion in life right now.
[Kojiroh] It's got a fancy laser-sight in front of\the trigger... I can take anyone out... At any\distance.
[Kojiroh] It's a crazy world out there... A man's\got to protect himself in this business.
[Kojiroh] I originally got this thing to intimidate\people. But it comes in handy when I need to blast\someone.
[Kojiroh] When I shoot, I aim for the legs.

[Kojiroh] I always have to check how much cash I've\got.
[Kojiroh] Damn... I used more than $30,000 in one\day...
[Kojiroh] Shit...
[Kojiroh] I can't keep this up...
[Kojiroh] Hey, there's a young girl in here!
[Kojiroh] What good will it do to whip it out right\now?
　Surroundings
　Lights
　Table
　Work desk
[Kojiroh] Purin and I are the only ones in the\office.
[Kojiroh] Purins over there struggling with the\laundry.
[Kojiroh] I yelled at her too much.
[Kojiroh] The lights are always on...
[Kojiroh] The electricity bill will be sky high.
[Kojiroh] It flashes non-stop, day and night.
[Kojiroh] I wonder how much this'll effect the\electricity bill.
[Kojiroh] I don't wanna think about that now.
[Kojiroh] It's the table, cluttered with empty cans\and old magazines.
[Kojiroh] Purin will clean it up, but I just mess\it up again.
[Kojiroh] But I can use it for lots of things...
[Kojiroh] It's the desk with my terminal on top.
[Kojiroh] It's the desk with my terminal on top.
[Kojiroh] There's no need to use it now.
　Go outside
[Kojiroh] Okay, I'd better buy a swimsuit first.

[Purin] I'm getting so excited!
[Kojiroh] Central Avenue is the place to go for\shopping. Let's go!

[Kojiroh] Am I gonna leave Purin like that?
[Kojiroh] Maybe I was too hard on her...
