[Kyoko] Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] Hey, you're here!
[Kyoko] You're late. I was beginning to worry.
[Kojiroh] Well... The guys who came after me... He\just wouldn't give up.
[Kyoko] What are you saying... You're still pretty\young.
[Kojiroh] My body doesn't seem to think so.
[Kyoko] Uh-oh...
[Kojiroh] What?
[Kyoko] What happened...there?
[Kojiroh] There...?
[Kyoko] There's blood on the floor... It's fresh.
[Kojiroh] Hey, you keep your nose out of my office.
[Kyoko] Could've gotten there this morning, maybe\even last night. Whose is it?
[Kojiroh] What are you talking about?
[Kyoko] So, I see...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] Fine. I'll tell you.
[Kyoko] We're partners, aren't we?
[Kojiroh] (Oh, Geez...)
[Kojiroh] (This broad sure is nosy...)
[Kojiroh] The truth is...
[Kyoko] Hey!
[Kojiroh] What!
[Kyoko] Why didn't you tell me this before!
[Kojiroh] You never asked.
[Kyoko] I didn't expect THIS to happen...
[Kojiroh] I was pretty surprised, too.
[Kyoko] Purins a member of the royal family? And\the Director, too?
[Kojiroh] That's right.
[Kyoko] I can't believe this.
[Kojiroh] Me neither.
[Kyoko] Should we believe it?
[Kojiroh] There's no reason not too.
[Kyoko] They probably just want to capture Purin.
[Kojiroh] Probably.
[Kyoko] I have to see Siria... I have to speak with\her.
[Kojiroh] It's useless. She is wanted.
[Kyoko] By whom?
[Kojiroh] Japan's criminal investigators, and the\former Eldian Intelligence Sector.
[Kyoko] ...Why?
[Kojiroh] Beats me.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] That's the low down.
[Kyoko] You're not hiding anything else from me,\are you?
[Kojiroh] Anything else? Like what?
[Kyoko] Anything regarding her?
[Kojiroh] Well... There was this in and out...
[Kyoko] Huh?
[Kojiroh] Nothing.
[Kyoko] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] (Whew...)

[Kojiroh] Oh man...
[Kojiroh] I feel a little down, actually...
[Kojiroh] There are too many things going around in\my head...
[Kyoko] Hey! What are you doing!
[Kojiroh] Don't look!
[Kojiroh] You wanna read the note??
[Kojiroh] "The moon will be full, the oasis will\moisten, and green shall return to the desert."
[Kojiroh] That's what it says.
[Kojiroh] Siria gave me this note.

[Kojiroh] Kyoko sure is giving it a good effort.

[Kojiroh] They've been on since this afternoon.
[Kojiroh] This can't be good for the electricity\bill...

[Kojiroh] It's a messy desk... I'll make Kyoko\clean it up later on.
[Kyoko] What did you say!?!
[Kojiroh] Nothing, dammit!
[Kojiroh] It's only been a day since Purin\vanished...
[Kojiroh] It's getting so messy...
[Kojiroh] Could Purin really be at the embassy?
[Kojiroh] You want to go see again?

[Kyoko] I said no, didn't I!?!
[Kojiroh] (Bitch.)
[Kojiroh] Is there any progress...?

[Kojiroh] Who, me?
[Kyoko] Yeah... I know you're up to something.
[Kojiroh] You must be joking.
　Kyoko
[Kyoko] Would you give me some time alone, please?
[Kyoko] I'm almost finished... Just a little more.
[Kyoko] I have to break this code... Otherwise, I\can't access the DMBS.
[Kyoko] What should I do...?
[Kyoko] Shit. I'm getting no where with this.
[Kyoko] The 4th protection uses random numbers...
[Kyoko] But it changes each time I access it! It's\impossible to break the code without a designated\numerical combination!
[Kyoko] Hmm...
[Kyoko] I broke the second one!
[Kyoko] I'll bet you're wondering how I did it...
[Kyoko] Well, if the 2nd is broken, the 3rd\locks... I just began with unlocking the 3rd!
[Kyoko] After breaking the 3rd, the 2nd one was a\cinch. Now all that's left is the 4th!
[Kyoko] But this one's a teaser.
[Kyoko] Hmm...
[Kyoko] Okay, now I understand the problem...
[Kyoko] In order to break the 4th protection, I\have to simultaneously break the 1st and 2nd\protections.
[Kyoko] If I fail, the 4th will be completely\locked.
[Kyoko] If I only break the 2nd protection, the 3rd\one will lock. They must both be broken\simultaneously to successfully break the 4th.
[Kyoko] But, how do I do it simultaneously?
[Kyoko] I should have the 2nd protection broken in\a little bit...
[Kyoko] But that happens, the 3rd will\automatically lock for good.
[Kyoko] I'm totally screwed if it's locked...
[Kyoko] Hmm...
[Kyoko] Yes! I unlocked one of them!
[Kyoko] Interesting... The 2nd protection was\merely a dummy of the 1st.
[Kyoko] I'm beginning to have hope again...
[Kyoko] Damn it... If we keep this up, we'll be\found.
[Kyoko] We must be nuts, trying to access the\government DBMS.
[Kyoko] I guess there's no turning back now though.
[Kyoko] Okay, I'll give it my best shot.
[Kyoko] The password was easy to figure out.
[Kyoko] I just entered today's date.
[Kyoko] The problem lies in all the protections\that'll show up.
[Kyoko] Hmm...
[Kyoko] Damn! The protection is too tough!
[Kyoko] And this is only the first obstacle...
[Kyoko] I'd like to be left alone for a while.
[Kojiroh] Any chances of success?
[Kyoko] I've only just begun...
[Kojiroh] Be honest. What are the chances?
[Kyoko] Honestly, the success rate here is very\low... I need luck. Lots of luck.
[Kojiroh] I see... Well, just try your best. You're\doing great.
[Kyoko] Thanks. I've come this far; I'm not giving\up.

[Kyoko] And on yours is the ugly one I so\despise...
[Kojiroh] Now you listen to me, you little\trollop...
[Kyoko] Sorry... I've reached a deadlock. I'm just\in a bad mood.
[Kyoko] My eyes are tired...
[Kyoko] I'm not doing so well here... I become\bitchy whenever I'm flustered.
[Kojiroh] Just take your time.
[Kyoko] I'm trying.
[Kyoko] First I have to solve the password... Then\break the protections.
[Kojiroh] Protections?
[Kyoko] Well, according to my research, there are 4\types of protections.
[Kojiroh] They've got this thing secure, don't\they...
[Kyoko] Just thinking about it discourages me...
[Kyoko] I don't get it...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] You're so fast... You're striking those\keys like there's no tomorrow.
[Kyoko] But I wonder why we use the term "strike"\when referring to typing.
[Kojiroh] ...No more boring topics, please.
[Kyoko] Sorry, I'm just flustered...
[Kojiroh] You're moving so fast...
[Kyoko] Well, yeah.
[Kojiroh] You could give me good time with those\strokes.
[Kyoko] I'll smack you one.
[Kojiroh] Sorry...
[Kojiroh] You've such beautiful shoulders... It\makes me want to protect them.
[Kyoko] Don't talk nasty to me.
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] Aren't you cold exposing your shoulders\like that.
[Kyoko] A little.
[Kojiroh] Oh.
[Kyoko] But that doesn't mean you can just put your\hand on my shoulder.
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kyoko] Hey...
[Kojiroh] Huh?
[Kyoko] Your hand's on my right shoulder.
[Kojiroh] Ha ha ha... I'm just expressing my\affection.
[Kyoko] Don't interfere with my work.

[Kojiroh] I got it, I got it.
[Kyoko] Dammit!
[Kojiroh] Ouch! There's no need to pinch me!
[Kyoko] I can't see what's in front of me.
[Kojiroh] Oh, yeah...
[Kyoko] Are you mocking me?
[Kojiroh] Sorry.
[Kojiroh] Good luck.
[Kyoko] Shit... I've run into a brick wall with\this thing.
[Kojiroh] Shit.
[Kyoko] No! This can't be!
[Kojiroh] I sense something's the matter.
[Kyoko] Will you please stop standing there like a\blithering idiot?
[Kojiroh] Now, now...
[Kojiroh] Good luck.
[Kyoko] I know... Just a little bit more...
[Kojiroh] Okay, Kyoko.
[Kyoko] Oh no! This is bad!

[Kojiroh] But more importantly...
[Kyoko] What??
[Kojiroh] I want to find out more on this Mido guy.
[Kyoko] Is there something suspicious about him?
[Kojiroh] Who knows... I think he's definitely\worth checking out, though.
[Kyoko] And?
[Kojiroh] Well... He kinda slipped a little when I\brought up Nikaido's name.
[Kyoko] How do you mean?
[Kojiroh] I only said his name, but he said that he\didn't know such a detective.
[Kyoko] Well, that's it then!
[Kojiroh] Yeah, but we were talking about\detectives so he said he just assumed Nikaido was a\detective.
[Kyoko] He's pretty sharp.
[Kojiroh] I want to know his history, what he's\been up to these past few years.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] What position he held in Eldia, his age,\his family... Kenneth Starr could probably tell me,\but he's busy at the moment.
[Kyoko] Yeah, it would help to know those things.
[Kojiroh] It requires a private data search...
[Kyoko] Which is impossible. The main database is\our only search mechanism.
[Kojiroh] You think it has this stuff on him?
[Kyoko] Yeah, not only the public sector, but it's\connected with the DBMS as well... Hey, what's\that look for?
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kyoko] No! We're screwed if anyone finds out about\this!
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kyoko] I'm a public servant, which means I can't\break the law!
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kyoko] No... No you don't!
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kyoko] Please dear God... Stop this fool!
[Kojiroh] Hey, what ever happened to us being\partners?
[Kyoko] You can't do this, Kojiroh. 

She starts typing...
[Kyoko] No, I can't believe this is happening...\I'll never trust you again!
[Kojiroh] Hey, you'll get over it in time.
[Kyoko] You shut up.
She punches the keys...
[Kyoko] You're in deep shit if anyone finds out\about this! This is unbelievable.
[Kojiroh] Come on, toots. We're partners, remember?
[Kyoko] Yeah, whenever you find it convenient.
[Kojiroh] Relax. Trust me...
[Kyoko] You just don't get it, do you... The DBMS\is protected by numerous protection devices.
[Kojiroh] All I need to do is solve the password,\and our job is a lot easier.
[Kyoko] Yeah, but even if we do get the access...\If they catch us, that'll be the end of it.
[Kojiroh] So how are you gonna do it?
[Kyoko] Well, I'm gonna use a public host, then go\access the Surveillance Organization Bros'\terminal.
[Kojiroh] Alright. So, including the S.O.B.'s,\we're going through two hosts then.
[Kyoko] Once there, I'm gonna go through their\terminal that attaches to their DBMS.
[Kojiroh] Alright, then total of four. That should\take them a while.
[Kyoko] Yeah, even if we're caught, it should take\them about five seconds to get back at us.
[Kojiroh] Only 5 seconds...
[Kyoko] That's if we're caught... If they don't,\then we can stay there forever.
[Kojiroh] But it won't be that easy...
[Kyoko] They might catch us right when we break in.
[Kojiroh] Well...
[Kyoko] If there was someone accessing at the same\time...
[Kojiroh] Then we can just catch a ride with them.
[Kyoko] It's not impossible... We have to use\perfect timing during the system deadlock. Jesus\Christ! I'm not supposed to be discussing this!
[Kojiroh] I'll grant you the title, "Kyoko the\Hacker."
[Kyoko] That would be a disappointing title to\have...
[Kojiroh] Hacker's are pretty hip. And then the\media gave it a negative image.
[Kyoko] I know that, but which image does my\"title" imply?
[Kojiroh] That all depends on whether or not your\performance results in some info.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kyoko] Oh yeah, by the way...
[Kojiroh] What is it?
[Kyoko] You mentioned your jacket when you were\talking about money.
[Kojiroh] Oh, that.
[Kyoko] Did something happen at the embassy?
[Kojiroh] Well, I think Purin is there.
[Kyoko] You're kidding!
[Kojiroh] One of the bodyguards at the embassy took\my jacket.
[Kyoko] Your jacket?
[Kojiroh] It's the one I lent to Purin... But all\my possessions are in it.
[Kyoko] Is that what she was wearing?
[Kojiroh] Yeah, I'm pretty sure...
[Kyoko] Can you be sure?
[Kojiroh] Well... I'm not 100% sure...
[Kyoko] But what if you are right?
[Kojiroh] Good question... I'm thinking about it.
[Kyoko] You're not...
[Kojiroh] Well, I've been thinking and maybe I'll\just go along with Hojo.
[Kyoko] Stop acting like an idiot!
[Kojiroh] Listen, let's just think more about this\later.
[Kyoko] I get so frustrated when I'm with you.
[Kojiroh] Well... Marina told the Ambassador to\increase the number of guards, but he said there's\nothing to worry about.
[Kyoko] So, what happened?
[Kojiroh] The Ambassador will go to an opera\tonight.
[Kyoko] An opera?
[Kojiroh] Apparently, he'll be there with an\honored guest.
[Kyoko] Well, that's good... At least you didn't\seem suspicious.
[Kojiroh] What the hell are you talking about?
[Kyoko] Huh?
[Kojiroh] It's a set up.
[Kyoko] What do you mean?
[Kojiroh] Don't you think it's weird? Right after I\leave, Marina comes in and talks to him about\what's gonna happen.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] And the Ambassador thinks I'm not\suspicious? Yeah, right!
[Kyoko] But...
[Kojiroh] You said yourself that I was\suspicious... The Ambassador thinks so too.
[Kyoko] Then what about the bug?
[Kojiroh] They know.
[Kyoko] Then why?
[Kojiroh] I don't know if it's good or bad, but\they still don't know who I am.
[Kyoko] So?
[Kojiroh] So they're trying to lead me on.
[Kyoko] What!?
[Kojiroh] Ignoring Marina's advice, the Ambassador\will go to tonight's opera with an honored guest?\Yeah, sure.
[Kyoko] Man... You figured out all this by\yourself?
[Kojiroh] Their conversation was too smooth... As\if they were reading from a script.
[Kyoko] And you caught on to it.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, but that Marina girl knows that,\too.
[Kyoko] What do you mean?
[Kojiroh] She probably set the whole thing up,\knowing that I'll figure it out.
[Kyoko] Why would she do that?
[Kojiroh] I think she's just trying to tell me that\she's on to me.
[Kyoko] But what if you hadn't figured it out?
[Kojiroh] If I was that stupid, then they probably\have nothing to worry about.
[Kyoko] And she set the whole thing up... Wow...
[Kojiroh] Or else, there's another possibility.
[Kyoko] What's that?
[Kojiroh] They're provoking me...
[Kyoko] You've GOT to be joking.
[Kojiroh] It's possible. I find that more\interesting.
[Kyoko] But why would they provoke you?
[Kojiroh] Who knows. Why is there hair on my balls?
[Kyoko] ...
[Kyoko] And then there's the embassy...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kyoko] You look pretty serious.
[Kojiroh] I just can't figure out that old guy,\Mido.
[Kyoko] Is there something strange about him?
[Kojiroh] He just won't show his real self. He's\like air, you can't catch him.
[Kyoko] Well, that's why he's an Ambassador...\That's his game.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, he wouldn't budge no matter what I\said.
[Kyoko] And what about Marina?
[Kojiroh] She wasn't there... At least, not in the\same room.
[Kyoko] Then where?
[Kojiroh] She was probably in some other room,\observing.
[Kyoko] Why?
[Kojiroh] I set up a bug in there.
[Kyoko] You actually did it!?
[Kojiroh] You heard me.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] What's wrong? You seem worried.
[Kyoko] Enough of your teasing... Now, where is\Marina?
[Kojiroh] She came straight into his office after I\left.
[Kyoko] So she was listening to the conversation\then.
[Kojiroh] Probably.
[Kyoko] So what did they say?
[Kojiroh] That I looked suspicious.
[Kyoko] Well, you do. Even now.
[Kojiroh] Come on...
[Kyoko] Anyway, what did the Ambassador say?
[Kojiroh] He just said that he's seen a lot of low\life scum like me.
[Kyoko] So he wasn't suspicious of you?
[Kojiroh] Doesn't seem like it from their\conversation.
[Kyoko] So he just thought you were an idiot.
[Kojiroh] You've got a sharp tongue.
[Kyoko] You bet I do.
[Kojiroh] Let's try to be a little more gentle.
[Kyoko] Could you show me the note, and the other\things?
[Kojiroh] Sure.

[Kyoko] Could there be anything else written on the\actual paper?
[Kojiroh] You mean, something written in invisible\ink?

[Kojiroh] Kyoko's having a hissy fit.
[Kyoko] What did you just say!
[Kojiroh] Are you always this angry with life?
[Kyoko] If you don't like my personality, get out\of my face!
[Kyoko] You're the only person I know who stares at\a table with bloodshot eyes.
[Kojiroh] This morning, with Siria...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kyoko] You're eyes are bloodshot, Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] The telecommunication lines are open,\from here we can access the network.
[Kojiroh] There's no need to use it now...
[Kyoko] At first look, it appears to be a boring\office... But there're actually lots of machinery\parts here.
[Kojiroh] I am a pro, you know?
[Kyoko] There are plenty of telecommunication\lines... We can receive all kinds of information\here...
　Bed
[Kojiroh] Oh well, I guess I will save the bed for\later.
[Kyoko] Don't bother saving it for later, I won't\sleep with you!
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] Fine, I'll quit.
[Kyoko] Don't take off your clothes.
[Kyoko] Don't ask me to sleep with you.
[Kyoko] What are you thinking!?!
[Kyoko] Your eyes are bloodshot, Kojiroh...
[Kyoko] Hey!
[Kojiroh] Where could Purin have gone?
[Kojiroh] We're all looking for you...

[Kojiroh] It's a painting of a bizarre painting...

[Kojiroh] I never go a single day without looking\at it at least once.
[Kojiroh] It's my Customized Glock 22... It's\helped me out quite a bit.

[Kojiroh] Thanks to this, I can make a living...
[Kojiroh] This isn't exactly the time to talk about\money.
[Kojiroh] I need some dough, but I have other\things to do first.
[Kojiroh] It's not feeling well.
[Kojiroh] It doesn't look like he's doing so well,\actually...
[Kojiroh] There are too many things going around in\my head...
[Kojiroh] You wanna read the note?
[Kojiroh] "The moon will be full, the oasis will\moisten, and green shall return to the desert."
[Kojiroh] That's what it says.
[Kojiroh] It's the memo that Siria gave me.
[Kojiroh] "The moon will be full, the oasis will\flourish, and green shall return to the desert."
[Kojiroh] Purin should know what this means...

[Kojiroh] She knew this place so well, in such a\short time...
[Kojiroh] She'd clean this place up so well that\it'd actually look like a normal warehouse.
[Kojiroh] But she's not here now...
[Kojiroh] They've been on since this afternoon...
[Kojiroh] This can't be good for the electricity\bill...
[Kojiroh] The lights are on...
[Kojiroh] They're the only thing that came with\this place.
[Kojiroh] It' a messy table. Got a problem with\that?
[Kojiroh] It's only a day since she vanished...
[Kojiroh] And the room's starting to get messy\again.
[Kojiroh] Akane was checking it out yesterday.
[Kojiroh] And all she had to do was ask...
[Kojiroh] The terminal with all my data is sitting\on top of it.
[Kojiroh] The telecommunication lines are open,\from here we can access the network.
　Go outside
[Kojiroh] Yeah, hanging around this place won't\make me feel any better.
[Kojiroh] Let's get some fresh air!

　My real name
[Kojiroh] I guess it's not about Purin.
[Kojiroh] Yes! It's Purin!
[Kojiroh] Then why does Purin have to send herself\something?
[Kojiroh] This doesn't make sense...
[Siria] Where I come from, only homeless people\talk to themselves... And loonies. You okay?
[Kojiroh] This isn't about Nikaido...
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah! It IS about that idiot, Nikaido!
[Kojiroh] His alias is, "Nikaido Stoleman."
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] It can't be...
[Siria] You sure get excited when you're alone.
[Kojiroh] Could this be about...Glen..?
[Kojiroh] Yeah, it could be about him...
[Kojiroh] Glen = Stoleman... Hmm...
[Kojiroh] But then again, I never knew his real\name.
[Siria] Have you thought this through enough?
[Kojiroh] I don't know Aqua's family name.
[Kojiroh] That's right! It's her!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I know... I'm wrong.
[Siria] You really enjoy talking to yourself, don't\you!
[Kojiroh] (That's right, it's Kou... The principal\of the international school!)
[Kojiroh] (It was in the paper, even... Stoleman\Kou. It was the real name of the man who was\killed.)
[Kojiroh] (Is it a note from Kou?)
[Kojiroh] (Wait a minute...)
[Kojiroh] (I remember that she disappeared when I\was talking with Himuro...)
[Kojiroh] (Purin dropped the dishes when Kou's\topic came up.)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (There must be a connection somewhere...)
[Kojiroh] (Purin is somehow connected with Kou...!)
[Kojiroh] (But then, how does this Siria broad come\into the picture?)
[Kojiroh] I don't know of this note.
[Kojiroh] That's right! That Stoleman character is\really me!
[Kojiroh] But when did I write this memo.
[Siria] I don't get you...

[Siria] It's just a copy. Do what you want to it.
[Kojiroh] Why are you giving this to me?
[Siria] You never know... She may be back here\soon...
[Kojiroh] Purin...?
[Siria] That's all...
[Kojiroh] Hey... Where are you going!
[Siria] To change my clothes... I'll catch a cold\like this.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] Or do you like me this way?
[Kojiroh] Uh, well...Uhh...not really.
[Kojiroh] (Shit! I almost let her know that I DO\like her like that!)

[Siria] I'm so happy to hear she wasn't captured by\those bastards.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] Be sure to hand her that note if you see\her.
[Kojiroh] Oh... Are you leaving already?
[Siria] Yes... There're so many things I have to\take care of.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] I'm wanted too, you know.
[Kojiroh] By whom?
[Siria] The Japan's criminal investigation team.\And another extreme group.
[Kojiroh] You mean the former Intelligence Sector?
[Siria] Maybe they're interested in my body...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] Anyway, thanks for looking after me. I'll\make it up to you someday.
[Kojiroh] Don't mention it... I don't expect\anything in return.
[Siria] And also, be sure to apologize to that\woman.
001
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] You've thanked me enough. I don't need to\hear anymore.
[Kojiroh] She's gone...
There's a plastic bag on the floor.
[Kojiroh] Whoa... It's a shopping bag.
[Kojiroh] Onions, beef, potatoes, stew mix...
[Kojiroh] Did she really come here to cook\breakfast?
[Kojiroh] She didn't have to cry...
[Kojiroh] What I did with Siria was because I was\concerned about Puddin...
[Kojiroh] Weird...
[Kojiroh] Siria... What a dame.
[Kojiroh] For your country, huh?
eve_21
[Siria] And what if I refuse?
[Kojiroh] I'll never sleep with you again.
[Siria] Oh, shut up...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] You're strange... You're so easy to talk\to... Although you may be my enemy.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] Alright, I'll tell you. She's a servant for\someone for an important figure.
[Kojiroh] Purin is?
[Siria] Right, and that someone is an essential\character in Eldia.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] There's no turning back if I tell you the\rest.
[Kojiroh] I'm already in this deep... Keep going.
[Siria] Her mission was to receive something from\Kou.
[Kojiroh] And what was it?
[Siria] Something very important for someone.
[Kojiroh] Something very important?
[Siria] Yes, and it can't fall into the wrong\hands.
[Kojiroh] So what the hell is it?
[Siria] I don't know. That's just what Stoleman\said.
[Kojiroh] Kou... And how is Stoleman connected with\Purin.
[Siria] They work for the same person.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Hey, Matsuno at the library...)
[Kojiroh] (Kou's family has been serving for\generations...)
[Kojiroh] (That's right...)
[Kojiroh] (Royal family...!?)
[Kojiroh] (Then that means, Purin serves...)
[Kojiroh] Royal family?
[Siria] Very good.
[Kojiroh] Why the hell is Purin being followed by\the former Intelligence Sector?
[Siria] ...
[Kojiroh] Did she steal the king's favorite\slippers or something?
[Siria] ...
[Kojiroh] (This chick should lighten up...)
[Kojiroh] Let's change the subject... Who killed\Stoleman?
[Siria] "Terror."
[Kojiroh] Siria, you used the same knife...
[Siria] That survival knife is distributed to\Eldia's military. Go to any shop in the Eldian\Republic and you can buy one.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] I work for the principles of patriotism. I\don't work for murder money like little old\"Terror."
[Kojiroh] Wow... Principles of patriotism.
[Siria] Exactly.
[Kojiroh] So who the hell is, "Terror"?
[Siria] An assassin. He's paid to kill.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] May I ask you something?
[Kojiroh] I win the bet.
[Siria] It was even.
[Kojiroh] You're showing good spirit.
[Siria] What's your relation to her?
[Kojiroh] Her husband.
[Siria] ...
[Kojiroh] Of course, Purin would be shocked to hear\me say that.
[Siria] Do you love her...?
[Kojiroh] I like her, and I want to protect her.\But I'm not in love with her.
[Siria] ...
[Kojiroh] We're just good friends, you see... We've\only met a few days ago.
[Siria] Oh...
[Kojiroh] But what kind of shit is she involved\with?
[Siria] ...?
[Kojiroh] There's a huge reward out for her.
[Siria] Yes, I know. It's set up by the former\Eldia Intelligence Sector.
[Kojiroh] The Intelligence Sector? ...What's that?
[Siria] I'm amazed. You honestly don't know\anything about her?
[Kojiroh] Honestly.
[Siria] Well then why are you sheltering her?
[Kojiroh] I'm not sheltering her. She just has\nowhere else to go. That's all.
[Siria] Is that all?
[Kojiroh] That's not enough?
[Siria] You didn't do anything to her, did you?
[Kojiroh] Oh, shut up.
[Siria] Touchy, aren't we?
[Kojiroh] So why would this former Intelligence\Sector put a reward out for her?
[Siria] If I tell you, what are you gonna do about\it?
[Kojiroh] I'll decide after I hear what it is.
[Kojiroh] (Purin...)
[Kojiroh] (...What the hell are you up to...)
[Kojiroh] You were saying you had to do something\for Purin?
[Siria] That's right.
[Kojiroh] And what must you do?
[Siria] Hand her a loveletter.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] It's a note.
[Kojiroh] Is that all?
[Siria] Yes... It's in my clothing.
[Kojiroh] I'm not falling for that one.
[Siria] It's true. Don't worry.
[Kojiroh] Then take it out...
[Siria] ...
[Kojiroh] (There's no reason to be so careful with\this chick.)
[Siria] This.
I look at the paper
[Kojiroh] (There's something written...in English.)
[Kojiroh] "The moon will be full, the oasis will\flourish, and green shall return to the desert."
[Siria] ...
[Kojiroh] What the hell is this?
[Siria] It's a piece of paper with a note written\on it.
[Kojiroh] You're getting more interesting as time\goes by.
[Siria] Thanks.
[Kojiroh] Now, back to my question... What does\that note mean?
[Siria] I was just supposed to get it to her. I\don't know what it means.
[Kojiroh] So you think Purin will know what it\means?
[Siria] She might.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] Give it to her when you see her. There'll\be big trouble if you don't.
[Kojiroh] Big...trouble?
[Siria] That's what they told me.
[Kojiroh] Who told you...
[Siria] Stoleman.
[Kojiroh] Stoleman?
[Kojiroh] (I've heard that name somewhere before.)
[Siria] ...
[Kojiroh] That Stoleman character...
[Kojiroh] First of all, I need to clear something\up.
[Siria] Go ahead.
[Kojiroh] Are those tits real?
[Siria] ...
[Kojiroh] Well?
[Siria] You're asking about my breasts...?
[Kojiroh] Is there something wrong with that?
[Siria] Well, obviously!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] Everywhere I go, men give me those horribly\perverse stares...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] They're always in the way! Not only with\fighting, but whenever I move... And my bra digs\into my shoulders!
[Kojiroh] Hey, I think they look perfectly good on\you. Just don't wear a bra!
[Siria] Please...
[Kojiroh] Come on, lighten up... Men only look at\you because you're attractive. We can't help it.
[Siria] Well, I don't like it.
[Kojiroh] I mean, shit... Looking at T N' A is in\our DNA. Give us some slack.
[Siria] ...
[Kojiroh] I know you like us staring at you...\Admit it.
[Siria] Well, I guess...
[Kojiroh] 'Atta girl.
[Siria] ...
[Kojiroh] (This isn't what I intended to ask\her...)
[Siria] And you are...
[Kojiroh] Kojiroh.
[Siria] So you just happen to start off every\relationship with a comment like that?
[Kojiroh] I can't explain it, but attractive women\just do something to me.
[Siria] ...
[Kojiroh] (We've strayed from the subject a bit...)
[Siria] Is that true?
[Kojiroh] Yeah. So what?
[Siria] Interesting...
[Kojiroh] Well, it's true.
[Siria] Is it really?
[Kojiroh] Just shut the hell up, already!
[Siria] Well, wasn't there something you wanted to\ask me?
[Kojiroh] Uhh... (Here goes nothing...)
[Kojiroh] It's about...that.
[Siria] The knife?
[Kojiroh] Is it your knife?
[Siria] Yes.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] You're making an awfully strange face,\there...
[Kojiroh] Well, I've been dealing with people who\like to kill others with knives.
[Siria] ...This is about "Terror," isn't it?
[Kojiroh] (Terror...?)
[Siria] I hate to break the news to you, but I'm\not an assassin.
[Kojiroh] Who'll believe you?
[Siria] I answered your question, didn't I?
[Kojiroh] What's "Terror"??
[Siria] The name of your little assassin.
[Kojiroh] So, you're not "Terror"?
[Siria] I'm might as well be the girl next door...
[Kojiroh] Who the hell are you, really?
[Siria] I'm a girl, but I don't live next door.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] You don't have a good sense of humor, do\you...
[Kojiroh] Answer me seriously. I know you're not\the amateur you say you are.
[Siria] Neither are you.
[Kojiroh] I'm a genuine amateur.
[Siria] That's not what I hear...
[Kojiroh] And who tells you this?
[Siria] A real nasty person...
[Kojiroh] ...?
[Siria] Don't I look like an average gal?
[Kojiroh] Sorry, but not a bit... Are you with the\army?
[Siria] Pretty sharp... But I'm not with them\anymore.
[Kojiroh] What unit?
[Siria] Well, I wish I belonged somewhere... I was\relieved several years ago.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (The way she carries herself, her\fighting style, her knowledge on weapons...)
[Kojiroh] (She's probably telling the truth.)
　Siria
　Tits
　Ass
　Thighs
[Siria] All bets are off.
[Siria] You want to do it again?
[Kojiroh] You wouldn't mind?
[Siria] Ah, never mind.
[Kojiroh] (Shit, don't even bother asking next\time.)
[Kojiroh] Her cheeks are still blushing.
[Kojiroh] I must've been good.
[Kojiroh] I guess I'm not getting anymore.
[Siria] You can look at them all day, but you're\not gonna get any.
[Kojiroh] Not even a little?
[Siria] Now that I think about it? I forgot to\squeeze your thing with it, huh?
[Kojiroh] !?
[Siria] But the bets are off.
[Kojiroh] Oh...
[Kojiroh] Don't stare like that.
[Kojiroh] Hey, why not listen to what Siria has to\say?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Siria] Don't look at it like you want it.
[Kojiroh] Oh, okay.
[Kojiroh] Your ass...
[Siria] I'll never give it to you...
[Kojiroh] Your ass...
[Siria] It still hurts...
[Kojiroh] Does it still hurt?
[Siria] A little...
[Kojiroh] That's because you put in some good\physical exercise.
[Siria] Speak for yourself... You're the one who\attacked.
[Kojiroh] Oh. ...Right.
[Siria] The treatment isn't bad... There's no\inflammation.
[Kojiroh] You owe me one.
[Siria] I know... I'll get back to you.
　Above Siria
[Kojiroh] Let's listen to Siria some more...
[Kojiroh] I said no, didn't I?
[Siria] Don't push me down when you say that.
[Kojiroh] Stop it, please.
[Kojiroh] Dammit.
[Kojiroh] Now you just wait a minute, you little...
[Kojiroh] Hey...
