[Kyoko] Oh, there you are. Where the hell were you?\I've been screaming your name!
[Kojiroh] Did something happen?
[Kyoko] Hurry up and get over here!

[Kyoko] Something happened alright.
[Kojiroh] Labor pains?
[Kyoko] This is no time for your stupid jokes.
[Kojiroh] You don't have to be so blunt...
[Kyoko] We lucked out. Just now someone accessed\the public safety DBMS.
[Kojiroh] Oh?
[Kyoko] The protection override gave up part way\through... But my patience paid off. I'll sneak in\behind this user.

[Kyoko] I think so...

Republic of Eldia0
A developing country located on the southern part of the Arabian peninsula. Adheres very strictly to the commandments of Islam, and continues to oppose the intrusion of Western culture. A republican monarchy until last year when the king died.0
At the same time, it joined the United Nations and began cultural reform, so, while it continues to remain Islamic, a blending of liberal customs and western culture is attracting much attention. Its major industries are minerals and tourism.0

[Kyoko] Look at this!
[Kojiroh] "Needs higher clearance" means that this\guy's a lower level dude.

[Kojiroh] Listen, baby, when you've come this far\there's no where else to go.
[Kyoko] You're asking me to cooperate with someone\when we don't even know who it is?
[Kojiroh] "Cooperate" is a little misleading. I\just mean take advantage of someone's superior\skills.
[Kyoko] You're so full of shit.
[Kojiroh] Oh, so you think it's a better idea to\just sit back and watch?
[Kyoko] So you mean that if we have the same\enemies that makes us allies?

[Kojiroh] Mother killed by terrorists...
[Kyoko] That's not so surprising in such an\unstable country.

[Kojiroh] Marina Hojo... That bitch is protecting\Mayako?

[Kojiroh] What's this "class 1 investigator" shit.
[Kyoko] Basically it means she's an agent with\commissioner status.
[Kojiroh] So she's hot shit like 007 or something?
[Kyoko] That's just in movies... Although she\apparently does have quite a lot of power. That's\just what I heard, anyway...

[Kyoko] Her status has been revoked?... How can\that be!?
[Kojiroh] That's what I want to know... She must\have done something pretty nasty.
[Kyoko] Maybe not. Once Internal Affairs gets\involved, your rank gets pulled in a second. She's\probably just suspected of something.
[Kojiroh] Like what?
[Kyoko] How would I know?... I doubt we can find\that out accessing the system at this level.
[Kojiroh] That sucks...
[Kyoko] Anyway, is that good enough for now?

[Kyoko] As long as you know the right escape\command to activate the shell. And I just happen to\know it.

[Kyoko] I used DBMS the proper way once before with\my boss.
[Kojiroh] ...

[Kyoko] So far, so good...
[Kojiroh] And? So what happened with your boss?
[Kyoko] Oh, he said that this way we could fall\victim to computer hackers. But I'm not absolutely\positive.
[Kojiroh] So what are you gonna do?
[Kyoko] We're getting a lot of free services from\the other user's memory device, you know.
[Kojiroh] Otherwise we couldn't get those services.
[Kyoko] Right. In other words, we're constantly\above the thing itself now.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kyoko] If we could activate the other user's\shell, we would instantly be taken out of the\service program. And if we can get out of there...
[Kojiroh] We could change the program itself. It\would even be possible to change the data.
[Kyoko] ... That's a terrifying thought. One could\conceivably erase family records.
[Kojiroh] Oh, so when things get a little\dangerous, you want to run and hide?
[Kyoko] Come on! I can't even tell when you're\serious and when you're not...
[Kojiroh] If you get fired for this, I promise I'll\take care of you.
[Kyoko] Yeah, right! You've got nothing to lose, so\don't worry about me.

[Kojiroh] (Kyoko seems to be a little tense...)
[Kojiroh] (Now I think it's my duty to relieve her\of that tension.)
[Kyoko] Kojiroh, don't just stand there and pick\your nose!
[Kojiroh] (It's not like her to have such a serious\look on her face...)
[Kojiroh] (She's really nervous... How cute)
[Kyoko] What's with you and that sissy face?
[Kyoko] Come on. Don't look around like that.
[Kojiroh] (Kyoko's fingers... They look so nice and\soft...)
[Kyoko] Hey! Do me a favor and keep your hands off.
[Kojiroh] (Such slender, delicate fingers...)
[Kojiroh] (I'll bet if she wrapped those fingers\around my hot dog I'd be in heaven...)
[Kojiroh] (Of course it could never even happen in\my wet dreams.)
[Kyoko] Kojiroh, wipe that perverted look off your\face.
[Kojiroh] I could care less about your stupid\shoulders. I have other things I could be doing\right now.
[Kyoko] Don't get so serious all the sudden!
[Kojiroh] God, you're really tense.
I massage her shoulders.0
\ 
[Kojiroh] Oh baby, I'm so glad I can be of service\to you.
[Kojiroh] You know I'd like to...
[Kojiroh] I'd like to do this with my tongue...
[Kyoko] If you even think about it, I'll kill you!
[Kojiroh] Yeah, sure baby, sure...
[Kojiroh] I'll bet if I really did lick you, you'd\like it.
[Kojiroh] Slurp!
[Kyoko] Quit mumbling, I can't understand a word\you're saying.
　Between Kyoko's legs
[Kyoko] I'm begging you, please take this\seriously.
[Kojiroh] (My piston is about ready to fire... I'd\better quit while I'm ahead.)
[Kyoko] Hey, cut that out.
[Kojiroh] Oh... Uh... Sorry.

[Kojiroh] What's the problem?
[Kyoko] I don't know... If this continues then the\other user will also be found out.
[Kojiroh] Forget about the other user. We're the\ones who'll get busted.

[Kyoko] You're right...
[Kojiroh] They realized that the first part needs\to be in capital letters.
[Kyoko] But why would they even try to access the\system manually? Why not use auto-login?
[Kojiroh] The auto setting must not work for some\reason.
[Kyoko] What do you think it is?
[Kojiroh] I wonder...

[Kyoko] I get the feeling this person doesn't know\exactly what he's doing.
Wait for a moment....0
[Kojiroh] Sure seems that way... Maybe he's one of\us.
[Kyoko] What do you mean, one of us?
Wait for a moment......0
[Kojiroh] I mean maybe he's accessing the system\illegally, like we are.

[Kyoko] Hey, Romeo, pay attention to the monitor.
[Kyoko] I'm gonna try and trace it... I can't mess\this up.
[Kojiroh] Go easy on yourself. When you make it\such a big deal you mess up things you normally\wouldn't.
[Kyoko] Thanks for the free advice. I'll do my\best...

[Kojiroh] (I should shut up. She can't relax when I\talk so much...)
[Kyoko] Alright, I'm gonna try and trace it now.
[Kyoko] I can't hold on to 'em...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] You're a dang fast typist. It's like\you're punishing the keyboard or something.
[Kyoko] I'm gonna punish you if you don't shut up\and let me type.
[Kojiroh] I like the sound of that...
[Kyoko] Shit!... We've hit a dead end.
[Kojiroh] You sure do move fast...
[Kyoko] Tell me something I don't already know.
[Kojiroh] When I think about being stroked by those\hands...
[Kyoko] You're about to get slapped by them, Big\Mouth!
[Kojiroh] Sorry...
[Kojiroh] What fragile shoulders you've got... I'd\like to put my arms around them.
[Kyoko] You make me want to throw up.
[Kojiroh] Thanks, babe, I love you too.
[Kojiroh] Aren't you a little cold with such short\sleeves?
[Kyoko] Maybe a little.
[Kojiroh] Well, in that case...
[Kyoko] But that doesn't mean you can just put your\greasy hands on them.
[Kojiroh] You've got a vicious tongue, my girl.
[Kyoko] Hey!
[Kojiroh] What?
[Kyoko] Why is there a hand on my right shoulder?
[Kojiroh] Heh, heh... It's a sign of affection.
[Kyoko] Quit bothering me, okay?
[Kojiroh] Alas, my affection is tragically dumped\upon.
　Leave the terminal

[Kyoko] Goddamit!
[Kojiroh] Sorry...
[Kojiroh] I guess this isn't the right time to fool\around...
[Kyoko] You're damn right about that. Keep off my\lap, monkey man.
