[Kojiroh] Kyoko won't pick up the phone...
[Kojiroh] Damn, what the heck is going on...?
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah. Kyoko's probably making up a\report.
[Kojiroh] I'll call the jerk.
I dial the number.Rrrring!...Rrrring!...

[Kojiroh] That's it! Nikaido's the dick I needed to\call.
[Kojiroh] Okay, here goes nothing. Now where did I\put Nikaido's number?...

[Kojiroh] Wait a sec, he isn't even part of this\world anymore.
[Kojiroh] I'm not sure I'm gonna like it if someone\actually picks up.

[Kojiroh] Small world. I need to talk to you too.
[Glen] Okay, let's hear what you have to say first.
[Kojiroh] It's about the girl.
[Glen] To tell you the truth, I still don't know\where she is...
[Kojiroh] No, not that. That problem's already been\solved.
[Glen] How?
[Kojiroh] I found her myself.
[Glen] You're something else, you know that?...\Shit, hat's off to you, man.
[Kojiroh] Listen, I don't plan on getting any\reward money out of this.
[Glen] I see. Then what are you gonna do?
[Kojiroh] Nothing. Nothing at all. I'm going out\with her right now...
[Glen] If you're going to the Princess Hotel I can\meet you there.
[Kojiroh] How'd you know where we're going?
[Glen] Call it a hunch... Seriously, though, I can\meet you if you need me.
[Kojiroh] What I really need is for you to leak\some information out to those shady brokers...
[Glen] What kind of information?...
[Kojiroh] Make sure they know that Purins been\found.
[Glen] I see...
[Kojiroh] Can you do it?
[Glen] Of course I can. It's just...
[Kojiroh] Is there a problem?
[Glen] Sometimes I'm not so sure about you...
[Kojiroh] What's there to not be sure about?
[Glen] To wave that much reward money around on a\stick... what do you want with the girl anyway?
[Kojiroh] You've got a pretty big mouth today. You\win the lottery or something?
[Glen] Sorry... You hate too many questions, right?
[Kojiroh] Something like that. Anyway, can you do\me this favor?
[Glen] Sure I can. You can count on me.
[Kojiroh] Thanks.
[Glen] So, what about the Princess Hotel? Should I\meet you there?
[Kojiroh] No, not this time. We're in a bit of a\hurry.
[Glen] You're going right away?...
[Kojiroh] That's right.
[Glen] I see... I'll send out the message alright.

[Kyoko] It just looks like an ordinary pattern to\me...
[Kojiroh] Did you hear about the story behind this\thing?

[Kojiroh] For better or worse, there's a story that\explains what's going on.
[Kyoko] ...
001

[Kojiroh] The guy who painted this thing was more\famous as an occultist than as an artist.
[Kyoko] The occult?
[Kojiroh] There's a curse. Everyone who gets\involved with this painting dies mysteriously.
[Kyoko] That's just a coincidence, right?
[Kojiroh] That's what I thought at first, too. But\the painter left a warning just before he died.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] "Those who lay hands on me, their\punishment will be severe, and thou shall suffer in\the fires of hell by the god's blade..."
[Kyoko] "The god's blade"... Holy shit!
[Kojiroh] I know the feeling. For some reason it\sounds a lot like what's going on right now.
[Kyoko] Are you saying there's some sort of\connection?
[Kojiroh] I just said it sounds similar. We can't\jump to conclusions.
[Kyoko] But...
[Kojiroh] I know, I know. I'm not saying that\there's no connection. I just can't figure out what\the connection is.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] To put it bluntly, I don't know my ass\from my pecker anymore.
[Kyoko] I don't want to know either of them...
[Kojiroh] Anyway, to summarize what we know, the\head of the Bureau of Science bites the dust... and\so does his son. Both deaths are sort of weird.
[Kyoko] Yeah...
[Kojiroh] Project C is started over from scratch,\but someone wants the results of the research\that's already been done.
[Kyoko] The result of the research was something\called 'A101'.
[Kojiroh] That's right. But there's something I\just don't get.
[Kyoko] The remnants of the former Eldian\Intelligence Sector took that data and disappeared.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, but what exactly is 'A101'?
[Kyoko] Isn't it written there at the end? Before\it gets cut off?
[Kojiroh] You mean this? "A101: The former Eldian\Science Ministry successfully developed this\groundbreaking..." This doesn't give us enough to\figure it out.
[Kyoko] So close but no cigar... We'll never get\another chance like that.
[Kojiroh] You're probably right.
[Kyoko] Everything's getting jumbled up in my\brain. It's all so confusing.
[Kojiroh] Tell me about it.
[Kojiroh] The former Intelligence Sector... What a\creepy organization.
[Kojiroh] The Intelligence Sector... This spy\shit's sort of fun to think about.
[Kyoko] How can anything be fun at a time like\this?
[Kojiroh] You don't find it the least bit\thrilling?
[Kyoko] Nope.
[Kojiroh] I wonder...
[Kyoko] But Ambassador Mido...
[Kojiroh] It said he was the original head of the\Bureau.
[Kyoko] He torched his own home for the sake of\reform.
[Kojiroh] What the hell was the purpose of that\former Intelligence Sector anyway?
[Kyoko] To turn the research into money.
[Kojiroh] Shit like 'A101'?
[Kyoko] That's right. It was the result of\research, right? I'll bet there are a lot of people\who'd like to get their hands on it.
[Kojiroh] A familiar enough story. But if that's it\then why would someone put such a big reward out on\Purin?
[Kyoko] I don't know about that... But the thing\Purin should have gotten from Kou must have been\'A101'.
[Kojiroh] Maybe... But if that's the case then why\does Kou have to be killed?
[Kyoko] Good question...
[Kojiroh] My thoughts seem to be shifting to\something else...
　About Mido
　About Kou
　About Purin
　About Terror
[Kojiroh] As much as I'm thinking about it, I can't\seem to come up with any good ideas now.
[Kyoko] Told you so.
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] I feel like I've seen a glimpse of the\big picture.
[Kyoko] The business about the ex-head of the\Eldian Intelligence Sector was pretty surprising.
[Kojiroh] Although it was disbanded...
[Kyoko] Mido himself is the one who done it.
[Kojiroh] All for the sake of political reform.
[Kyoko] And now the remains of the disbanded\Intelligence Sector are operating behind the\scenes...?
[Kojiroh] Sure seems that way.
[Kyoko] ... I have my suspicions about Mido\himself, but I don't get the feeling he's committed\any crime.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kyoko] What are you thinking?
[Kojiroh] There's something on my mind.
[Kyoko] The jacket with the money in it? Figures.
[Kojiroh] Laugh if you will, but you're right.
[Kyoko] Obviously it was just a coincidence. You\shouldn't worry about every little thing.
[Kojiroh] Are you kidding me?
[Kyoko] What?
[Kojiroh] You know Purin, the girl Eldia's former\Intelligence Sector put so much money out to find?\Her jacket was found in the Eldian embassy.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] If you see no connection here, then go\find another day job.
[Kyoko] What are you saying?! Nothing can be done\about it!
[Kojiroh] Something can definitely be done about\it.
[Kyoko] Like what?
[Kojiroh] Let me think about it.
[Kyoko] You're not making any sense.
[Kojiroh] The real Kou died...
[Kyoko] If only we could ask the phony Kou about\it.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] The real Kou was already dead...
[Kyoko] Kou the Director must have gotten caught in\the middle of something.
[Kojiroh] Right. Even the search for the\painting... Well, the actual request to do the job\came from the mysterious fatass who disappeared.
[Kyoko] The situation with that painting doesn't\line up at all with this information. What could\the connection be?
[Kojiroh] Beats me...
[Kyoko] Maybe there's no connection after all.
[Kojiroh] What's that supposed to mean?
[Kyoko] It could just be that two entirely\different sets of events occurred simultaneously.\Since they seem to affect each other, we\automatically jumped to the conclusion that they're\connected.
[Kojiroh] So the situation with the painting and\the stuff with Mido and Project C are completely\separate issues?
[Kyoko] I can't be sure... But it's definitely a\possibility.
[Kojiroh] It's too unnatural. It's more natural to\see the connection.
[Kyoko] Alright then, Sherlock, what's the\connection?
[Kojiroh] Beats the hell out of me.
[Kyoko] You're hopeless...
[Kojiroh] (Purin... Where the hell are you?)
[Kojiroh] (Are you at... the embassy?)
[Kyoko] Somebody's personal maid, right?
[Kojiroh] Not so fast, that's only what I heard.\She hasn't confirmed it.
[Kyoko] But if that's really the case...
[Kojiroh] It's easy to imagine a lot of things, but\there's no evidence.
[Kyoko] I know, I know.
[Kojiroh] In the end it's just something that Siria\said.
[Kyoko] True. And then there's that note... Do you\have it with you?
[Kojiroh] Uh, yeah... "The moon will be full, the\oasis will moisten, and green shall return to the\desert."
[Kyoko] Siria wanted to give this note to Purin.
[Kojiroh] Or, more exactly, the Director Kou wanted\to. Siria was only asked to do it.
[Kyoko] What place does she hold?
[Kojiroh] Which she?
[Kyoko] Purin. She was supposed to get something\from Kou, right?
[Kojiroh] Right. She didn't tell me what it was.
[Kyoko] What if it was actually 'A101' or\something...
[Kojiroh] What are you saying?
[Kyoko] I don't know... It's just that she's\supposedly a maid, right?
[Kojiroh] Right. Which means there's somebody\sponsoring her.
[Kyoko] Royalty...
[Kojiroh] It seems likely. But the King was\assassinated...
[Kyoko] What about the Queen?
[Kojiroh] I wonder... But anyone who'd put that\girl in danger can't be any good.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kyoko] The more you think about it the more\uncanny this assassin becomes...
[Kojiroh] You've got that right...
[Kyoko] What a terrible son of a bitch...
[Kojiroh] Identity , sex, age, or race, all\unknown... It's almost inconceivable.
[Kyoko] Appears out of thin air, does his dirty\work, and disappears back into the wind...
[Kojiroh] Like a ninja or something. On top of\that, a 100% success rate.
[Kyoko] I can't believe it...
[Kojiroh] It's certainly harder to believe than to\not to believe.
[Kyoko] Why use a knife, I wonder?
[Kojiroh] Probably because it's an effective\weapon. Makes no sound, leaves no trace. It has an\overwhelming advantage in close-range combat.
[Kyoko] What I was actually asking was why use the\official Eldian army knife.
[Kojiroh] Because he likes it?
[Kyoko] Come on, seriously!
[Kojiroh] Really, thinking about it won't give us\any solid answers.
[Kyoko] Well... Yeah, but...
[Kojiroh] Is this the very prick who killed Kou?
[Kyoko] And what about Nikaido?
[Kojiroh] That's a tough one. Why would Nikaido\have to be killed?
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] 'Terror' is just the pro who was\contracted to do the kill.
[Kyoko] Who put out the contract... That's the\problem.
[Kojiroh] There's got to be a ton of guys who'd\want to kill Nikaido for sleeping with their women.\Whether or not 'Terror' was hired is a completely\separate issue.
[Kyoko] That's true... It's too soon to make an\assumption just because a knife was used.
[Kojiroh] Someone could have just wanted to use a\knife to make it look like a 'Terror' job.
[Kyoko] But we don't have any evidence that\suggests it wasn't 'Terror' either.
[Kojiroh] ...
　Kyoko
[Kyoko] Now what?
[Kojiroh] Let's see, a top-notch assassin from the\Middle East, the Japanese government, and Eldian\former Intelligence Sector. We'll wage war against\all three of them.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] What's with that face? You look like\you're in your deathbed.
[Kyoko] It's just that I'm amazed by your nerves.
[Kojiroh] Nothing's changed. Don't worry about it.
[Kyoko] Why are you getting so involved with this\case?
[Kojiroh] I'm moved by the passion in your eyes.
[Kyoko] Of course you're lying.
[Kojiroh] Don't be so cruel...
[Kyoko] Why?
[Kojiroh] I don't remember.
[Kyoko] You said something about helping people.
[Kojiroh] Did I say that?
[Kyoko] You did.
[Kojiroh] I have no recollection of that.
[Kyoko] Save the bullshit politician routine. I\want to know what you're in this for.
[Kojiroh] I've told you before. It's a combination\of my indignation towards the foul deeds of\criminals and my desire to contribute to social\well-being.
[Kyoko] Forget I asked.
[Kojiroh] If you don't mind, then, do me a favor\and don't ask me again. I have my own private\reasons.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] You don't see me invading your privacy\about the issue, do you? So return the favor, okay?
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] And don't make that diarrhea face. You\said we're partners in crime, remember?
[Kyoko] Don't put words in my mouth.
[Kojiroh] It's the truth.
[Kyoko] Do you have to be so irritating?
[Kojiroh] Yes. What are you going to do, anyway?
[Kyoko] About what?
[Kojiroh] You said it yourself, about the\Principal's embezzlement scandal.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] Even if he retires, no one blames him.
[Kyoko] You're going to continue the race?
[Kojiroh] You got it, baby.
[Kyoko] But why?
[Kojiroh] For the sake of the woman I love...
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] Wipe that look off your face. I was\joking. J-O-K-I-N-G. Okay?
[Kyoko] It didn't sound much like a joke to me.
[Kojiroh] Why.. Why do you say that?
[Kyoko] You're stuttering.
[Kojiroh] Shut up. Why would I think about shit\like the former Intelligence Sector and politics\for a broad. It just ain't worth it.
[Kyoko] Oh yeah? You're still acting awkward.
[Kojiroh] Hey, gimme a break, will ya!
[Kyoko] Hee hee! Now don't get so angry.
[Kojiroh] For Christ's sake...
[Kyoko] Count me in, too.
[Kojiroh] Wow. You know you're putting your career\on the line.
[Kyoko] What we've already done is more than enough\to ruin it anyway.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kyoko] What, are you worried about me?
[Kojiroh] I guess I feel a little responsible.
[Kyoko] That's not like you at all... Don't worry.\If the shit hits the fan I'll have you to look\after me.
[Kojiroh] Huh?!?
[Kyoko] You look pretty nervous. Just kidding. I\wouldn't want to bother your lover.
[Kojiroh] Hey... I said cut it out!
[Kyoko] I just wanted to see your reaction, that's\all.
[Kojiroh] You're a handful, you know... Anyway,\shall we get going?
[Kyoko] Get going? Where?
[Kojiroh] To school.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] Remember I told you I saw an inventory of\paintings in the Director's room?
[Kyoko] You're pretty tough, cowboy...
[Kojiroh] I can tap that ass all night long, baby.
[Kyoko] Are you planning on breaking in?
[Kojiroh] You catch on quick.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] You're just going to school to get\something you forgot. I'm your boyfriend who's come\to meet you.
[Kyoko] My boyfriend?
[Kojiroh] I'll get lost and accidentally wind up in\the Director's room, and you just happen to go that\way.
[Kyoko] My boyfriend...
[Kojiroh] Suddenly I become dizzy and collapse on\the book shelf, and the inventory book just happens\to fall in front of me... What do you think?
[Kyoko] ... Boyfriend...
[Kojiroh] Hey, snap out of it!
[Kyoko] Oh! Sorry. What were you saying?
[Kojiroh] What do you think of the plan?
[Kyoko] My boyfriend?
[Kojiroh] Why are you so hung up on that minor\detail?
[Kyoko] If we're breaking in anyway, it doesn't\make any difference, does it?
[Kojiroh] I guess not.
[Kyoko] Sounds fine with me. I won't complain\anymore about my career or anything like that.
[Kojiroh] (What do you call what you're doing right\now?)
[Kyoko] ... And I would like to find out what's up\with the Director, too.
[Kojiroh] Well, that's a plan.
[Kyoko] Okay, how about meeting in front of the\school gate?
[Kojiroh] Why? Are you embarrassed to go with me?
[Kyoko] No, dumb-ass! I just have to go home and\change into my uniform first.
[Kojiroh] Good idea. I prefer the nurse look\though.
[Kyoko] Pervert!
[Kojiroh] Quit calling me names.
[Kyoko] If we get caught, it'll be more convincing\if I'm wearing my uniform, won't it?
[Kojiroh] I guess you're right.
[Kyoko] I'll go back to the girls' dorm.
[Kojiroh] Dress up nice, hot stuff.
[Kyoko] Pervert.
001
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] So we're meeting in front of the school's\gate...
eve_03
[Kyoko] Let's collect our thoughts a little first.
[Kojiroh] Good idea.
[Kyoko] For now just read it, okay?
[Kojiroh] Okay.
　Surroundings
　Kyoko
　Print log
[Kojiroh] I've got to read it again?
The Eldian government responded to the death of Doleman Kou, the head of the Ministry of Science and the termination of the project was resolved.
Furthermore, due to the assassination of Stoleman, the international school's Director, the government recognized the threats of the Middle East and cut off any funds to the former Eldian Ministry of Science. The project was fully discarded.
The head of the Intelligence Sector, Ross Mido, responded to this action made by the government, and The Intelligence Sector and Ministry of Science were both dissolved. The top-secret Project C was also terminated.
Intelligence Sector 2 is concentrating all efforts to locate 'A101', and the search for the former Eldian Intelligence Sector member and his accomplices wanted for larceny of the classified material, has been requested to Prime Minister Lloyd.
The search for Mido and his two Asian executives...
'A101': The former Eldian Science Ministry successfully developed this groundbreaking...
[Kojiroh] The log cuts off here. We must have been\found out...
[Kyoko] Don't you want to read the rest?
[Kojiroh] Right... 'Intelligence Sector 2 is\concentrating all efforts to locate 'A101'. What\the hell is this 'A101' crap?
[Kyoko] It must be a code-name for something.
[Kojiroh] Intelligence Sector 2 must have something\to do with the former Intelligence Sector.
[Kyoko] You think so?
[Kojiroh] I've heard it's a scary place.
[Kyoko] But what could it have to do with the\Eldian government?
[Kojiroh] It's written right here. They tried to\take the research results and run with them.
[Kyoko] What on earth could they have been\searching for?
[Kojiroh] Probably that A101.
[Kyoko] ... I'll read on.
...and the search for the former Eldian Intelligence Sector member and his accomplices wanted for larceny of the classified material, has been requested to Prime Minister Lloyd.
[Kyoko] The former Eldian Intelligence Sector?
[Kojiroh] There's more.
[Kyoko] 'The search for Mido's two Asian\executives...' It cuts off mid-sentence.
[Kojiroh] Mido and his two Asian executives... Who\could they be?
[Kyoko] What about Mido and the Kou father and son?
[Kojiroh] The two Kou's weren't part of the former\Intelligence Sector. It doesn't seem right to say\they are the two execs.
[Kyoko] You're right... Let's collect our thoughts.
[Kyoko] Have a look.
[Kojiroh] Well, what have we got here...
[Kyoko] Don't stare at my breasts you pervert!
[Kojiroh] Where should I look then?
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] Just kidding! Don't be so serious. The\log printout, right?
[Kyoko] Right. It's pretty sticky stuff.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kyoko] It's more than an embezzlement by a school\Principal.
[Kojiroh] You mean there was more?
[Kyoko] More than you can handle. Just read it.
[Kojiroh] ...
' The Eldian government responded to the death of Doleman Kou, the head of the Ministry of Science and the termination of the project was resolved.'
[Kyoko] Doleman is Director Stoleman Kou's father.
[Kojiroh] The head of the Eldian Ministry of\Science.
[Kyoko] I guess it's obvious that when the Big\Cheese dies his organization can't function.
[Kojiroh] But look at the next part. "The\government recognized the threats of the Middle\East and cut off any funds to the former Eldian\Ministry of Science. The project was fully\discarded."
[Kyoko] What does it mean?
[Kojiroh] Stoleman Kou was murdered for political\reasons.
[Kyoko] Political reasons...?
[Kojiroh] If he was killed by 'Terror', then\obviously someone had to hire 'Terror' to do it.
[Kyoko] I guess you're right... So there was a\crisis in the project itself?
[Kojiroh] That's what it looks like.
[Kyoko] I'll continue reading...'The head of the\Intelligence Sector, Ross Mido, responded to this\action made by the government. The Intelligence\Sector and Ministry of Science were both\dissolved.'
[Kojiroh] That was also written in Mido's personal\report.
[Kyoko] Yeah... The ex-head of the Intelligence\Sector. I don't like the sound of it.
[Kojiroh] 'And the top-secret Project C was also\terminated.' What the hell is this 'Project C'\thing?
[Kyoko] I think it's the 'Neo Cerebral Project'\thing.
[Kojiroh] 'Neo Cerebral Project'...
[Kyoko] Something about new brains.
[Kojiroh] Who knows what that could mean...
[Kyoko] Beats me.
[Kojiroh] (What the hell is this Project C?)
[Kojiroh] (Kyoko's looking pretty serious...)
[Kojiroh] (I guess I have no choice but to\listen...)
[Kojiroh] (It's just me and Kyoko here alone...)
[Kojiroh] (Purins nowhere around.)
[Kojiroh] (The atmosphere's still a little intense\in here...)
[Kojiroh] (She's relaxing a little with my tasty\coffee...)
　Go outside
[Kyoko] Hey!
[Kojiroh] I know, I know... Women!..
[Kyoko] Where do you think you're going?
[Kojiroh] To the bathroom.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] My motto is, work hard until the whole\blue sea turns yellow with my piss.
[Kyoko] Kojiroh. Does the word "stupid" mean\anything to you?
[Kojiroh] No. Not much.
