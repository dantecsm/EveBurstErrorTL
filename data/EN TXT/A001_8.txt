[Kojiroh] I'm back in my office...
I feel a twinge.0

eve_41
[Kojiroh] Shit. It's starting already.
[Kojiroh] Dang... Never any time to relax.

[Akane] Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Did you bring them?
[Akane] Well... Yeah, but...
[Kojiroh] Hurry up and hand 'em over.
[Akane] But what do you need handcuffs for?
[Kojiroh] Because I need 'em.
[Akane] But...
[Kojiroh] I explained on the way over, didn't I?
[Akane] Yeah...
[Kojiroh] We can't underestimate the power of\drugs. There's no telling what I might do after\withdrawal symptoms set in.
[Akane] ...Okay.
She gives me the cuffs.
[Kojiroh] So, which of these beams looks the\sturdiest...?
[Akane] What should I do?
[Kojiroh] Just relax. Take a hot shower, and rest.
[Akane] Yeah, right! Who's gonna look after you?
[Kojiroh] This is my problem. You've done enough.\Now it's my turn.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] Okay, this beam is probably the\strongest...
[Kojiroh] Seeing as how I just reinforced the area\around the gate...
[Kojiroh] Yeah. It's hard and fat and tough as my\cock... right?
[Akane] Can you forget your damn penis, for now at\least?
I attach the handcuffs to the beam and lock myself in.
[Akane] Are you sure there's nothing I can do?
[Kojiroh] Don't you dare do anything.
[Akane] ...
I try to break free of the beam.0

[Kojiroh] Feels pretty secure...
I try to pull away as frantically as I can.
[Kojiroh] I can't budge. Even a gorilla couldn't\get out of this.
[Akane] Kou... Kojiroh... I...
[Kojiroh] Just shut up and listen for a second,\okay?
[Akane] Sure...
[Kojiroh] Starting now... I'm gonna be pretty crazy\all night long.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] I might be in a lot of pain, screaming\and shouting, asking for your help, but don't pay\any attention to me. Alright?
[Akane] What do you mean 'Alright?' It's not\alright at all.
[Kojiroh] Everything depends on this process of\ridding the drug completely from my system. If\everything goes okay, it will be chased away by the\morning sun...
[Akane] But...
[Kojiroh] No buts.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] Go to bed. You're tired, right?
[Akane] Well, yeah, but...
[Kojiroh] And don't forget to wear earplugs.
[Akane] Alright, already, I got it! I'll leave you\alone!
0560
[Kojiroh] Thank you.
[Kojiroh] This will be a true test.
[Kojiroh] It's been about an hour since I got shot\with the antidote.
[Kojiroh] Pretty soon I'll go into withdrawal...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] That bastard...
I start coughing
[Voice] Are you okay?
[Kojiroh] Okay? Of course I'm not okay...
[Voice] What an incredible experience... Most\people never experience anything like this.
[Kojiroh] Can't you talk about anything else.
[Voice] Just trying to be cheerful.
[Kojiroh] God, you're a handful.
[Voice] That girl saved your ass.
[Kojiroh] That's right. Akane helped me.
[Voice] She's not a half bad dame... Kojiroh, is\she your woman?
[Kojiroh] Shut up!
[Voice] Just kidding.

[Kojiroh] Did you see Yayoi?
[Man] No.
[Kojiroh] Why not?
[Man] There's no need to.

[Kojiroh] No, it's just...
[Yayoi] Of course, you always act weird, don't\you...?

[Kou] Unfortunately we weren't able to meet when I\was alive...
[Kojiroh] Yeah, what a shame.
[Kou] You know I did call your office? Once.
[Kojiroh] So it was you.
[Kou] It was unlucky how I was captured by Pat's\former Intelligence Sector.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] They removed my fingernails, drilled holes in\my teeth, and broke my fingers, but I didn't tell\them where the National Seal is hidden.
[Kojiroh] What! What are you saying?
[Kou] I'm saying that the National Seal was stolen\by rebels. That I don't have it anymore. I tried my\hardest to make Pat believe me. But...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] But you found it. What do you plan on doing\with the scenario I slaved over to create?!
[Kojiroh] I... All I did was my job...
[Kou] Heh-heh-heh... I know. You were just doing\your job for the money. Just like "Terror"...
[Kojiroh] "Terror"...?!
[Kou] I was murdered by "Terror"... Although,\there's also another way to say it...
[Kojiroh] What do you mean?...

[Akane] He was killed at the Princess...
[Kojiroh] Who? Who's 'he'?...
[Akane] I was serious about getting the story, and\I just got more and more stuck on Nikaido.
[Kojiroh] What are you saying, Akane...?
[Akane] Nikaido was hired by Ambassador Mido...\He's trying to get the National Seal, too.
[Kojiroh] Mido... wants the National Seal?

[Kojiroh] Nikaido. Tell me what the heck you're\doing!
[Voice] I took you for a ride man. Both you and\Akane.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Voice] Kojiroh, you truly performed marvelously.\Of course you did get hung up on the double tricks\at Kou's place.
[Kojiroh] So you're the one who two-timed us.
[Voice] That's right. For twice the usual salary,\Mido willingly bought the National Seal from me.\The original that was together with the painting.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Voice] Then I financed Katsuragi Detective\Offices, with the plan to actually become the owner\of the office.
[Kojiroh] But your plan got messed up.
[Voice] Exactly. It was a miscalculation when you\beat me through the double trickery, and...
[Kojiroh] Then what happened?
[Voice] Let's see...I guess getting murdered by\"Terror"...

[Nikaido] I was murdered by "Terror", but you can\also say it a different way...
[Kojiroh] What does that mean?...
[Nikaido] Avenge my death, Kojiroh... The one who\killed me came unexpectedly...
[Kojiroh] Unexpectedly...
[Nikaido] Yes... No, perhaps not so unexpectedly.
[Kojiroh] What are you trying to say?...
[Nikaido] You feel that he's near when he isn't,\when you think he will kill he doesn't. Close but\not really... It may be someone like that.
[Kojiroh] Nikaido...?
[Nikaido] Not to mention that it may not be just\one person... No. It may be just one person, or\maybe none.
[Nikaido] If you think that the same person is\doing the killing, the carpet may be swept from\under your feet. I wonder if you can solve it,\Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] What's that supposed to mean...?
[Nikaido] I look pretty strange, don't I. My neck\was dislocated, ruined my handsome looks.

@Hit Katsuragi
[Kojiroh] (I'll forgive him this once...)
[Kojiroh] Son of a bitch!
I swing and miss.
[Katsuragi] You seem a little slow.
[Kojiroh] (Shit... I'm not feeling so hot.)
[Kojiroh] (I guess I'll have to let it slide this\time...)
I stumble.
[Kojiroh] Huh...?
[Katsuragi] So far so good. When you move it helps\the drug circulate faster.
[Kojiroh] ...
@Katsuragi
[Katsuragi] ...God, this is a terrific cigar.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] I have something to give you.
[Kojiroh] ...?
0565b
[Kojiroh] This...?!
[Katsuragi] That's right. It's a piece of the\painting. I found it in Stoleman's office. It was\entrusted to him.
[Kojiroh] In the Director's room...
[Katsuragi] Exactly.
[Kojiroh] So this is the National Seal... And the\other half is with the fatass.
[Katsuragi] You catch on quick. Give this to the\Queen for me.
0565
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] ...
[Kojiroh] What do you plan on doing?
[Katsuragi] I don't think we'll see each other\again.
[Kojiroh] What are you going to do with Yayoi!
[Katsuragi] You take care of her.
[Kojiroh] Hey! Act like a father!
[Katsuragi] Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] What?
[Katsuragi] There are things I need to do... and\these things aren't always safe.
[Kojiroh] So what? You think that's a good enough\reason to abandon Yayoi?
[Katsuragi] What can I do at this point? She's\dependent as much as her independent will.
[Kojiroh] I know that...
[Katsuragi] I'm sure she's probably given me up for\dead by now.
[Kojiroh] Probably.
[Katsuragi] So what am I supposed to say now? 'Here\I am, darling. Your dead dad. Don't be surprised if\I die again soon.'
[Kojiroh] ...Okay, I get it. Do as you please.
[Katsuragi] Call it my ego. Please take care of\her.
[Kojiroh] Do you want to die?
[Katsuragi] I have no suicidal tendencies.
[Kojiroh] What would you do if you came back alive?
[Katsuragi] I'll relocate to a foreign land and\live a quiet life.
[Kojiroh] Spreading your seed again?
[Katsuragi] That sounds quite nice...
[Kojiroh] I'll come visit you with Yayoi.
[Katsuragi] Be my guest.
[Kojiroh] I'll bring a kid. I'll make you feel old\all over again.
[Katsuragi] Sounds terrific.
[Kojiroh] You're a piece of shit.
[Katsuragi] Takes one to know one.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Dang! There's nothing I can do about\it.)
[Kojiroh] (Yayoi...)
[Katsuragi] Well, should we get going?
[Kojiroh] Where?
[Katsuragi] To my lover's place...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] Just kidding. Then we'll go to the\ship.
[Kojiroh] To the ship?!
[Katsuragi] Where else is there? The only other\place I can go to is my lovers'.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] Don't be a fool, Kojiroh. If you cause\Yayoi any pain I won't even forgive you.
[Kojiroh] Look who's talking.
[Katsuragi] You're right... Look what time it is.\Hell is right around the corner for you.
[Kojiroh] I guess so... I'm already starting to\sweat.
[Katsuragi] Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] What?
[Katsuragi] Later, I'll give you the payback for\Yayoi's tears.
[Kojiroh] What?
[Katsuragi] I do love my daughter, you know. I hope\we meet again.
[Kojiroh] What do you mean?
[Katsuragi] I hear you met with Siria...
[Kojiroh] What do you know about that?
[Katsuragi] She's my daughter.
[Kojiroh] What?!
[Katsuragi] I made a mistake back in Eldia...
[Kojiroh] What a confession to make...
[Katsuragi] I trained her myself. She's top of the\line, even amidst the Intelligence Sector.
[Kojiroh] You bastard, what about Yayoi...?
[Katsuragi] That was another seed I planted in a\different hole. That one died after labor.
[Kojiroh] Hey, don't look so disgusted.
[Katsuragi] But every girl I've been, I literally\loved her to death. Just like you.
[Kojiroh] Don't you say we're alike. I don't just\go around like you, shooting off my nuts into\anything that moves.
[Katsuragi] Siria... She's a true patriot...
[Kojiroh] (The bastard changed the subject...)
[Katsuragi] Siria... She hates my guts, you know?
[Kojiroh] Why?
[Katsuragi] Because I abandoned my country and ran\away...
[Kojiroh] I see. It's like when you left her\mother, a deadbeat pervert...
[Katsuragi] Is that what Siria said?
[Kojiroh] Her exact words.
[Katsuragi] And you slept with her?
[Kojiroh] (Yikes) What makes you think that?
[Katsuragi] Call it intuition, and my intuition is\always right.
[Kojiroh] ...You got me. Unfortunately Yayoi walked\in on us when we were balling!
[Katsuragi] Hmm, did she cry?
[Kojiroh] She'd never cry in front of me.
[Katsuragi] She's probably sobbing in her office...
[Kojiroh] Probably.
[Katsuragi] Do me a favor and take care of them\both.
[Kojiroh] What are you thinking?!
[Katsuragi] I couldn't do anything as a parent for\Siria. All she learned from me is combat and\survival skills.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] That's why she hates me so much. If she\meets Yayoi, she'd probably hate her too.
[Kojiroh] Does Siria know about... Yayoi?
[Katsuragi] Of course not. And I'm not going to\tell her. I don't want to see any sibling rivalry.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] ...What a delicious cigar.
[Kojiroh] So Siria was spying at the fatass' place.
[Katsuragi] She seems to be working for the\Queen-in-waiting.
[Kojiroh] ...Prisia?
[Katsuragi] Precisely. I'm the one who picked the\meeting place for Stoleman and the\Queen-in-waiting.
[Kojiroh] Stoleman...?
[Katsuragi] He asked me for advice.
[Kojiroh] Close to my office...
[Katsuragi] I figured it would be best to do it in\front of your barracks. Then if it comes to it, he\could call on the hobo detective living there.
[Kojiroh] Are you referring to me when you say\'hobo detective'?
[Katsuragi] Who else?
[Kojiroh] Son of a bitch...
[Katsuragi] God, I love cigars...
[Kojiroh] So Kou was killed by "Terror" then?
[Katsuragi] Could be...
[Kojiroh] Yes or no?
[Katsuragi] Could be...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] The Queen-in-waiting is a fine human\being...
[Kojiroh] Yeah, Purin's the best.
[Katsuragi] But...
[Kojiroh] But what?
[Katsuragi] ...This cigar is delicious.
[Kojiroh] But what?!
[Katsuragi] Did you mess around with her?
[Kojiroh] Fool, She's only 18, right?
[Katsuragi] Yeah, I can get with that.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Old timer.
[Katsuragi] What?
[Kojiroh] Why are you doing all this?
[Katsuragi] I told you 3 months ago.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] To tie up loose ends...
[Kojiroh] Loose ends...?
[Katsuragi] When I found out everything about the\project, I ran off. I got scared. I ran away like a\puppy with my tail between my legs.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] That was about 2 years ago...
[Kojiroh] The same time you became the head of\Katsuragi Detective Offices...
[Katsuragi] I wanted to forget the past and start\anew... What wishful thinking.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] But Mido and Pat wouldn't let me slip\away. Then exactly 3 months ago I was contacted by\Doleman's son.
[Kojiroh] You mean Stoleman Kou?
[Katsuragi] That name has been associated with the\royal family for generations. We were so close.\Doleman Sr. was strictly professional, through and\through.
[Kojiroh] Strictly... what?
[Katsuragi] To put it bluntly, he was a\professional maniac. As long as there was money he\kept moving, like a damn hamster in a wheel.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] I hear that Stoleman murdered his\father.
[Kojiroh] The son killed his father...?!
[Katsuragi] In order to stop the project...
[Kojiroh] But Doleman was head of the Ministry of\Science.
[Katsuragi] That's right. The sponsor stopped\funding him.
[Kojiroh] Sounds nasty.
[Katsuragi] But it was too late.
[Kojiroh] Huh?
[Katsuragi] It was already complete.
[Kojiroh] What was?
[Katsuragi] The fruit of Doleman's labors.
[Kojiroh] ...!?
[Katsuragi] In order to cover it up, the Prime\Minister instigated massive reform.
[Kojiroh] Reform... That's what's going on right\now?
[Katsuragi]The plan is to dissolve the Intelligence\Sector, dissolve the Ministry of Science, and put\an end to everything.
[Kojiroh] Finish... everything?
[Katsuragi] No. I suppose the true intent is to\start all over.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] But the Prime Minister...
[Kojiroh] The Prime Minister...
[Katsuragi] Forget it... There's no use talking\about it now.
[Kojiroh] ...Did it have something to do with the\King's death?
[Katsuragi] ...
[Kojiroh] Didn't "Terror" assasinate the King?
[Katsuragi] "Terror"? Don't be ridiculous...
[Kojiroh] What's so funny about that?
[Katsuragi] Well, perhaps you could say he did...
[Kojiroh] Perhaps?
[Katsuragi] "Terror" is truly terrifying... You\will never reveal everything about it. Ever.
[Kojiroh] Who is it?
[Katsuragi] I don't know anymore.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] Nikaido was so pitiful... He went\without knowing the truth about "Terror".
[Kojiroh] But he must have learned when he died.
[Katsuragi] I wonder...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] Perhaps you see the connection?
[Kojiroh] Connection?
[Katsuragi] Yes.
[Kojiroh] Are you trying to test me? You've taught\me well.
[Katsuragi] Guess the connection.
[Kojiroh] "Terror" started activity exactly 2 years\ago.
[Katsuragi] Right.
[Kojiroh] 2 years ago... The same time you returned\to Japan.
[Katsuragi] Exactly.
[Kojiroh] 2 years ago "Terror" appears, and you\come running to Japan with your tail between your\legs.
[Katsuragi] You can leave that 'tail between the\legs' out, actually.
[Kojiroh] Which means the advent of "Terror" and\the project were interfering with each other.
[Katsuragi] Precisely. There's a connection.
[Kojiroh] Is there?
[Katsuragi] I'm not sure,... but yes, there must\be.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] Then I shall ruin their plan.
[Kojiroh] What?...
[Kojiroh] (Katsuragi will...)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] This cigar is delicious to smoke by the\ocean wind.
[Kojiroh] ...But why?
[Katsuragi] Why what?
[Kojiroh] Why are you being chased by the Eldian\Intelligence Sector.
[Katsuragi] Do you remember where I was before?
[Kojiroh] Before...?
[Katsuragi] I was overseas for a long time... on\the pretext of business.
[Kojiroh] Oh, yeah. Once you were vacationing with\Yayoi, but...
[Katsuragi] At that time I was working for the\Eldian Secret Service...
[Kojiroh] !...
[Katsuragi] There was a time when the three Asians,\Mido, Pat, and I, controlled Eldia.
[Kojiroh] So you were the third Asian... the\leader.
[Katsuragi] That's right. Mido devised the\strategy, Pat thought up the illegal yet effective\tactics, and I executed.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] Eldia was a young nation... She opened\her doors to anyone. It became a melting pot.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] It was a young blooming country filled\with vigor. I felt like I had found a second home.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] It didn't take long for me to want to\work for the sake of the nation.
[Kojiroh] You wanted to work for sake of the\nation... That doesn't seem like you.
[Katsuragi] For young Eldia to gain a voice in the\Middle East took a lot more than the Prime\Minister's diplomatic charm.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] Because the Prime Minister is who she\is, it seems like she really worked to build the\country. But there was another factor that helped.
[Kojiroh] The Secret Service...
[Katsuragi] Exactly. We did quite a bit of nasty\work...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] The Secret Service was a lot of fun...\for me at least.
[Kojiroh] Fun...?
[Katsuragi] Fun. I gladly did things too terrible\for you to even imagine.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] But the Secret Service basically\thrives on deceit, cheat, espionage, theft, and\manipulation of people.
[Kojiroh] Sounds perfect for you.
[Katsuragi] But once I accidentally saw the results\of my actions.
[Kojiroh] Did something happen?
[Katsuragi] We tried to trespass into God's\territory... Anything for the sake of the country.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] For the sake of the country... When\people follow this motto they can break all laws.\They become numb.
[Kojiroh] Like criminals.
[Katsuragi] Then I realized what was happening.
[Kojiroh] What?
[Katsuragi] A private project had been advanced in\Eldia, using gigantic funding from advanced\countries.
[Kojiroh] You don't mean the Project C, do you?
[Katsuragi] So you know more than I thought. Pretty\impressive...
[Kojiroh] Not really. I still don't know what the\hell it is. Tell me.
[Katsuragi] Well...
[Kojiroh] Keep your smoke out of my face.
[Katsuragi] Actually the instigator of the project\was none other than myself.
[Kojiroh] What?!
[Katsuragi] I confess.
[Kojiroh] And that's what Doleman developed?
[Katsuragi] You're getting good at this.
[Kojiroh] That new drug...?
yŒj–Øz‚Ó‚£`ddB
[Kojiroh] Hey! Quit making me cough!
[Katsuragi] What a great cigar...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (This old man was the head of the former\Eldian Intelligence Sector...)
[Kojiroh] (It's too hard to believe...)
[Kojiroh] Are you gonna let me hear it?
[Katsuragi] Sure, my favorite tune, 'My Way'!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] ...
[Kojiroh] Thanks for not singing it.
[Katsuragi] I forgot the lyrics.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] ...
[Kojiroh] And?
[Katsuragi] Oh, yeah. Where were we?
[Kojiroh] Why did you bother to show up? Why help\me?
[Katsuragi] By chance.
[Kojiroh] By chance?
[Katsuragi] I was investigating myself when Mr.\Shithead detective came along. I didn't have the\heart to leave him out of it.
[Kojiroh] You're the shithead...
[Katsuragi] Whatever you say. Here, take this pill.
[Kojiroh] What does it do?
[Katsuragi] It will counteract the drug.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] There are, however, some considerable\side effects.
[Kojiroh] Like what?
[Katsuragi] It looks like you were given 10 or 20\times the normal dosage... I can't accurately\measure what you'll experience.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] But it will be even worse if you don't\take this pill.
[Kojiroh] I still feel a little dizzy...
[Katsuragi] Hurry up and take the pill.
[Kojiroh] ...
I take the pill.
[Kojiroh] Tastes great, less filling.
[Katsuragi] It will begin in an hour.
[Kojiroh] What will?
[Katsuragi] You'll know in an hour. Just make sure\to secure yourself to someplace you can't move.
[Kojiroh] ...I think I'm getting the idea of what\you mean by 'side effects'.
[Katsuragi] But after you get through that, your\body will be completely free of the drug. It will\probably take a few hours.
[Kojiroh] ...Is it any different from typical\withdrawal symptoms?
[Katsuragi] Not even... You'll go mad.
[Kojiroh] Don't be so calm when you say shit like\that!
[Katsuragi] I know you can handle it.
[Kojiroh] (Is that a compliment?...)
[Katsuragi] Anyway, there's still some time before\that happens.
[Kojiroh] Yeah... Back to where we were?
[Katsuragi] Yes.
[Kojiroh] So you're the one who started all this\shit?
[Katsuragi] No. There was this radical female. A\gorgeous woman.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] For some reason I end up doing a lot of\things with her.
[Kojiroh] She a pro?
[Katsuragi] That's what they say. She's got quite a\head on her.
[Kojiroh] Marina Hojo...
[Katsuragi] Oh, you know her?
[Kojiroh] She's an acquaintance of your daughters'.
[Katsuragi] Whoa. What if she ended up being\Yayoi's mother.
[Kojiroh] Keep your bullshit in your pants.
[Katsuragi] I'm not kidding.
[Kojiroh] Now you're starting to scare me...
[Katsuragi] So, what do you want to know next?
[Kojiroh] (Don't change the subject...)
[Kojiroh] Finish telling me about what happened 3\months ago.
[Katsuragi] Okay.
[Kojiroh] I had no idea what was going on. Why did\you have me make the arrest?
[Katsuragi] I needed to get away from the public\eye. In order to hide myself from their eyes.
[Kojiroh] Whose eyes? Hide from what?
[Katsuragi] From the Eldian Department of\Intelligence.
[Kojiroh] What?!
[Kojiroh] (The Eldian Intelligence Sector was after\Katsuragi...?)
[Kojiroh] (Whatever could it mean?...)
[Kojiroh] I'm shocked.
[Katsuragi] I know. My good looks cause a lot of\problems for me.
[Kojiroh] It's a miracle I don't kick your ass. Why\are you alive!?
[Katsuragi] When did I say I was dead?
[Kojiroh] Dead people don't say they're dead,\shithead.
[Katsuragi] Which means I must not be dead.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] Don't think about it too deep.
[Kojiroh] Anyway... Yayoi's really worried. You\should show up and tell her you're alive.
[Katsuragi] That's none of your business.
[Kojiroh] What do you mean, none of my business?
Katsuragi blows smoke in my face.
[Kojiroh] You're gonna give me freakin cancer...
[Katsuragi] Delicious! This cigar is heavenly. It's\wetness is first-class.
[Kojiroh] ...Why did you fake death?
[Katsuragi] I would really die otherwise.
[Kojiroh] Were you under heat?
[Katsuragi] Sure...
[Kojiroh] The police are still after you though?
[Katsuragi] I'm dead. You won't find anybody by my\name in the books.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] So I can't show myself to Yayoi.
[Kojiroh] Damn...
[Katsuragi] Now I go by Suzuki. I'm an agent at\SunPlus Insurance Company.
[Kojiroh] You're still using that phony company?
[Katsuragi] Yep. I've even registered the company.\They won't bother to check it up.
[Kojiroh] But if you go to the address, you'll find\a vacant lot. It can't be the real thing.
[Katsuragi] It's real on paper.
[Kojiroh] Do me a favor and face the other\direction when you blow it out.
[Katsuragi] No.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Selfish son of a bitch...)
[Kojiroh] (I'm remembering more and more...)
@Surroundings
@Katsuragi
@Cigar
@Mustache
[Kojiroh] All I hear is the sound of the waves...
[Kojiroh] It's a quiet beach...
[Kojiroh] I can hear the gentle sound of the\waves...
[Kojiroh] Until just now I was faltering between\life and death in that ocean...
[Katsuragi] Without my help you would have drowned.\You owe me big.
[Kojiroh] Don't wait around for me to pay you back.
[Kojiroh] This beach is close to a ship dock...
[Kojiroh] It's already passed midnight... There's\no one around. Just me and Katsuragi.
[Katsuragi] It's been awhile since I came here...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (It's my ex-boss, Katsuragi...)
[Kojiroh] (I'll see what he has to say...)
[Kojiroh] You're quite a handful...
[Katsuragi] A man should be cool, like me.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, right...
[Kojiroh] The ex-head of Katsuragi Detective\Offices...
[Kojiroh] The guy whom I arrested and handed over\to the police...
[Katsuragi] I'm an ex-con, thanks to you.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (He's smoking a cigar... The brand\Katsuragi likes.)
[Kojiroh] Looks like the smoke is delicious...
[Kojiroh] I don't smoke that shit myself... Can't\figure out what's so good about it.
[Katsuragi] It feels good. You'll understand after\you grow up.
[Kojiroh] Don't make me sick.
[Kojiroh] That cigar's become a sort of trademark.
[Katsuragi] Want one?
[Kojiroh] No thanks.
[Katsuragi] Are you sure?
[Kojiroh] Actually I do want one.
[Katsuragi] Well you can't have one.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Katsuragi] If you want one, you have to grow one\of these first.
[Kojiroh] Forget it. It hardly looks real.
[Katsuragi] Don't pull on it...
[Kojiroh] Sorry.
[Kojiroh] When did you start growing it?
[Katsuragi] 3 months ago...
[Kojiroh] When I arrested you...
[Katsuragi] I figured I could use a little\camouflage.
[Kojiroh] (It looks terrible...)
@In the ocean
@Go home
[Kojiroh] (That's stupid. Forget it.)
[Kojiroh] (First I need to talk to this prick.)
