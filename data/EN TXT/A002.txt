[Woman] Are you Mr. Amagi?
[Kojiroh] Yeah. You got a case for me?
[Woman] Yes, you're Mr. Amagi...
[Kojiroh] (I've seen this girl somewhere before...)
[Woman] Do you know if a girl happened to come by\here...?
[Kojiroh] A girl?
[Woman] A blonde, with tan skin... She looks like\she's in her late teens.
[Kojiroh] (She means Purin...)
[Kojiroh] (But who the hell is this broad?)
[Woman] She's easy to notice... You'd know if you'd\seen her.
[Kojiroh] Sorry, but I don't know any girls like\that around here.
[Woman] Pardon me for asking, but do you live here?
[Kojiroh] Yeah, I live right in that warehouse...
[Woman] I see...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Woman] Are you sure you haven't seen her?
[Kojiroh] Listen, lady... Why the hell would a\beautiful girl like that be hanging around a\neighborhood like this?
[Woman] I see.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (What's with this chick... She's sweating\bullets.)
[Woman] Well, I happened to see her here...
[Kojiroh] Well it doesn't concern me anyway. Why\are you looking for her?
[Woman] We're friends. Good friends...
[Kojiroh] (I'm getting a bad signal from her... And\I mean bad!)
[Kojiroh] (This woman is trouble... I can feel it.)
[Woman] Why do you stare at me like that?
[Kojiroh] Why? Because you're a fox, and you've got\a nice rack.
[Woman] ...
Hmm...

[Kojiroh] Hey!
[Woman] Mmm...
[Kojiroh] Are you okay?

[Woman] Sorry, I'm anemic.

[Nikaido] Now, how did I ever get myself lost in\this part of the town?
[Kojiroh] So?
[Nikaido] Ha ha ha ha... I think I understand the\mystery behind that painting.
[Kojiroh] The...mystery?
[Nikaido] I just searched for what you were\searching for. But unlike you, I understood that\mystery.
[Kojiroh] I see.
[Nikaido] There's something very mysterious behind\that little thing... There's no reason I should be\wasting this information on you.
[Kojiroh] I'm not asking you to.

[Kojiroh] Yeah, I think I heard it from the\warehouse next door.
[Kojiroh] Who could it be... Maybe Purin??

[Kojiroh] Listen... Take these two and beat it.
[Guy in middle] ...
[Kojiroh] Hey, I don't think these two will be able\to feed themselves anymore. That's okay, you can\feed 'em. Now, beat it.
[Guy in middle] You son of a bitch...
[Kojiroh] Boo!
[Guy in middle] ...
[Kojiroh] What's the matter, you ain't hungry?
[Guy in middle] I am hungry...
[Kojiroh] Good, then take these and go eat some\spinach. You all could use a little spinach.

[Kojiroh] Good boy. I like a man who knows how to\do what he's told.
[Kojiroh] Hey! Don't forget to clean the saliva off\the ground!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Well, that takes care of them.
[Kojiroh] I'd better clean up around here.
[Boy] ...
[Kojiroh] Hey.
[Boy] ...
[Kojiroh] Can't you hear me? Hello?
[Boy] Oh! Please forgive me! I'll do whatever you\want!
[Kojiroh] Come on, kid...

[Kojiroh] I like that. I have a clear conscience\after pulverizing those guys.
[Kojiroh] And I was just admiring how quiet this\place was...
[Kojiroh] Thanks to that kid, this place has made a\new impression on me.

[Boy] Umm...
[Kojiroh] Are you hurt anywhere?
[Boy] I don't feel hurt anywhere...
　Boy
　Punks
[Boy] Help me, please.
[Guy on left] Looks like some drunk fool is\sticking his nose where it don't belong.
[Guy on right] Shall we begin with him?
[Guy in middle] Let me begin... I've got lots of\aggression to take out.
[Boy] Stop it!
[Guy on right] Shut up!
[Kojiroh] Nobody's heard me...
[Guy in middle] So, you catch on fast.
[Guy on left]
[Guy on right] Come on! Lemme see it!
[Kojiroh] Hey, WATCH YOUR FOUL MOUTHS!

[Guy on right] Who the hell are you talking to?
[Guy on left] What, are you drunk?
[Kojiroh] (These guys just look like punk-ass\students.)
[Kojiroh] (These guys are in for an extracurricular\activity.)
[Kojiroh] (I know the type... These guys think it's\fun to go hit people.)
[Guy in middle] Hey! Say something!
[Kojiroh] Oh, I was just saying how you guys\probably enjoy beating up on people.
[Guy in middle] Of course it is...
[Guy on left] It's a stress reliever. Surely, you\must've tried it.
[Guy on right] Or maybe you're just a pussy.
[Kojiroh] Hey... If that's your word for\"non-violent," you must be a bunch of virgins.
[Guy on left] We're just cleaning the streets of\these bums. Stay out of our way.
[Guy on right] And then we charge them for our\services.
[Guy in middle] And then we'll make you pay your\fees...
[Kojiroh] Sorry guys, but I'm broke.
[Guy on right] What did you say!?!
[Kojiroh] But I've got something to pay as\collateral.
[Guy in middle] So, you're catching on fast.
[Kojiroh] I'll give you something you'll love.
[Guy in middle] I can't wait.
[Guy on left] It better be good.
[Guy on right] Are you trying to start shit with\us? Huh?
[Kojiroh] (This punk acts like he knows Karate...)
[Kojiroh] (This'll be a little messy...)
[Guy on right] Why don't you say something?
[Kojiroh] I'll get around to it.
[Guy on right] You wanna get killed, man?!?
[Guy in middle] Are you drunk off your ass?
[Guy on left] Ignore the bastard... Let's take care\of this shit.
0010
[Guy in middle] Yeah, yeah...
[Guy on right] This guy wants to be a human\punching bag... I'll show him some good moves.
[Guy in middle] Hey kid, don't even think about\going to sleep.
[Boy] I...wasn't...
[Kojiroh] (These punks aren't acting the way they\should...)
[Kojiroh] Hey, shitbags! Don't talk to strangers,\you could get hurt...
0010b
[Guy on left] What did he just say?
[Guy in middle] Who do you think you are?
[Guy on right] Do you got a deathwish, ass-eyes?
[Guy on left] You're digging your own grave, old\man!
[Kojiroh] Old...man?
[Guy in middle] You heard me! What, are you deaf\AND stupid?
[Kojiroh] (This guy's beginning to piss me off...)
[Kojiroh] (I'm older than he, and yes, I use\Viagra... But I can kick this punk's ass\blindfolded.)
[Kojiroh] (But I wouldn't call myself an old\man...)
　Boy

[Kojiroh] (I should stop watching and help out.)
[Kojiroh] (I've been in worse predicaments than\this... Three guys will be easy.)

[Kojiroh] (I have to do something to save that\kid...)
[Kojiroh] (I can't just stand here and watch these\idiots push him around.)
[Kojiroh] (These guys are as bad as Larry, Curly,\and Moe...)
[Kojiroh] (I'll clean up this place in no time...)
　Run away
　Help
[Kojiroh] There's no way I can run away from the\situation now...
[Kojiroh] Hey, I can't just run away now? I'll miss\all the fun!
[Kojiroh] I'd never let that happen...
[Kojiroh] Come on, let's help the little booger.

[Kojiroh] (The kid in the blue cap is being pushed\around...)
[Kojiroh] (I shouldn't stand here and watch this\happen.)
[Kojiroh] (The last thing I want to do is become\involved in more trouble...)
[Kojiroh] (Why don't these guys just stop!)
[Kojiroh] (That kid looks so weak...)
[Kojiroh] (The kid in the blue cap and red vest...\Maybe he was going fishing.)
[Kojiroh] (Naahhh...)
[Kojiroh] (There are three punks in this\picture...)
[Guy on left] Come on, sissy! Say something!
[Boy] Please...
[Kojiroh] (Kids these days say the damnedest\things...)
[Kojiroh] (But this kid's built just like me...)
[Kojiroh] (That guy's got a crewcut.)
[Kojiroh] (That style only takes 5 minutes to cut.\I can knock him into unconsciousness sooner than\that.)
[Kojiroh] (I'll be his barber for now...)
[Kojiroh] (Buzz is giving a dirty look to the kid.)
[Guy on left] Speak up, fool! You sick little\monkey!
[Boy] ...
[Kojiroh] (I can't just sit here watching this\anymore...)
[Guy in middle] This wimp needs to respect\authority better.
[Guy on left] Let's turn him into a human punching\bag!
[Guy in middle] Come on! I'd love to sink a good\one right into your gut!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Guy on right] Heh heh... Let's kick his ass...
[Kojiroh] (Damn, I knew this was coming.)
[Kojiroh] (These guys are some bad apples...)
[Kojiroh] (These guys need to learn a lesson...)
[Boy] Ouch! Stop it, please! Please!
[Guy in middle] This little punk is a foreigner!\He's got an accent!
[Guy in middle] What's a matter? You don't like\Japanese??
[Kojiroh] (The kid's a foreigner...??)
[Guy on right] Dammit! Give it to me!
[Kojiroh] (I'm not getting good vibes from this\scene...)
[Guy on right] Hand it over, before I make you!
[Boy] ...
[Guy on right] You probably stole it from someone,\right? Don't worry, we'll use it for you.
[Kojiroh] (It's getting out of hand.)
[Guy on right] Come on. Say somethin'.
[Boy] ...
[Guy on right] That kid's pretty soft spoken.
Smack!
[Boy] Ouch!
[Kojiroh] (Now he's starting to make some\sounds...)
[Kojiroh] (The one on the right has the biggest\muscles.)
[Kojiroh] (I'll have to remember to take him out\first...)

[Kojiroh] (I'd better check out what's going on\before I interfere...)

[Kojiroh] Down we go...
[Kojiroh] Whew...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Okay, now I'm seated...

[Kojiroh] I only look at my office at night...\Shit.
[Kojiroh] See, at night it doesn't look as old and\dirty as it really is.
[Kojiroh] If I ever get a sign, I'll write that I'm\only open at night.
[Kojiroh] But who the hell would come looking for a\detective in this neighborhood?
[Kojiroh] Even at night, the snob's boat is\anchored in port.
[Kojiroh] It's about a mile away from here... Maybe\I can reach it with a rock. Here's one!
I throw it, and it lands...
[Kojiroh] I didn't even make it a tenth of the\way...
[Kojiroh] That place is called Central Avenue...

[Kojiroh] It's always the pretentious ones who make\sure they own the finest things in life. And they\always show off.
