[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] It's already daybreak...
[Kojiroh] The sky is gradually whitening into\morning...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] The sea blossoms into dim morning light.
[Kojiroh] I can feel the wind blowing in from far\away.
[Kojiroh] It's a little chilly.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I have to go now...
[Kojiroh] ...Over there.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Akane] Kojiroh! Where are you!
[Kojiroh] Hey, Akane! I'm outside!
[Akane] ...
b26
[Akane] Are you alright, Kojiroh?
[Kojiroh] I'm alright...
[Akane] Oh...
[Kojiroh] What's the matter?
[Akane] There's something different about your\face...
[Kojiroh] Oh... It must look pretty bad.
[Akane] No, you just look skinnier... I think it's\nice.
[Kojiroh] Thanks.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] ...Go on and take a hot shower.
[Akane] But I'm glad you're okay now.
[Kojiroh] You looked after me all last night...
[Akane] But you looked like you were dying! What\did you expect?
[Kojiroh] Yeah... It was a living nightmare.
[Akane] At least you're feeling better.
[Kojiroh] I owe you one, Akane.
[Akane] Don't mention it.
[Kojiroh] Well, thanks anyway. I'm gonna get goin'.
[Akane] Why...?
[Kojiroh] I must go.
[Akane] You shouldn't have to work this much!
[Kojiroh] You're right. I don't have to.
[Akane] So then, why...?
[Kojiroh] Do you only do things when you have to?
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] When I uncover this whole case, I'll let\you know first thing.
[Akane] Don't worry about that... Just be careful.
[Kojiroh] Hey, you're not yourself today, are you?
[Akane] You bastard!
[Kojiroh] Come on, Akane...
[Akane] Sorry.
[Kojiroh] Did I ever tell you what great tits you\have?
[Akane] Shut up... Take care of yourself, okay?
[Kojiroh] I'll be just fine.
[Akane] By the way, I think they delivered you the\paper by mistake.
[Kojiroh] Was there anything interesting in it?
[Akane] Well, Katsuragi Private Detective Offices\has the next Eldian Queen in protective custody.
[Kojiroh] Hey, Yayoi ain't doin' so bad.
[Akane] You mean, with Purin?
[Kojiroh] Yeah.
[Akane] Why?
[Kojiroh] I don't need any reputation, you know.
[Akane] You just want Yayoi, right?
[Kojiroh] Maybe...
[Akane] I guess I'm getting jealous.
[Kojiroh] Don't worry... I've got special eyes just\for you.
[Akane] Don't expect anything... I'll be waiting.
[Kojiroh] Good. I'll return... I promise.

[Kojiroh] Calm down... Everything's okay.
Purin cries...
[Kojiroh] Here, take my handkerchief... There's no\need to cry like this...
[Purin] Sorry... Whaaa!
[Kojiroh] Now, now... No more tears...
[Purin] What should I do...?
[Kojiroh] What do you mean?
[Purin] There's this person... I can't go see that\person like this!
[Kojiroh] Well, who's that "person"?
nPurin cries and cries...
[Kojiroh] Come on...
[Purin] ...I can't stop...
[Kojiroh] Tell me what happened.
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] Just calm down and you'll be back to\normal again.
[Purin] Why do you care so much for me...?
[Kojiroh] I'll never let you go, Purin.

[Kojiroh] The sunlight glitters in my eyes.
[Kojiroh] That's because I was in front of the\monitor for such a long time.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I'm supposed to meet Kyoko at the\international school.
[Kojiroh] But there's a slim chance I'll be able to\meet the fat Kou.

[Kojiroh] Let's stop this...
[Kojiroh] Hey!
[Kojiroh] Hey, didn't I say we shouldn't do this?
[Kojiroh] It's not very crowded right now, you\know?

[Kojiroh] I'll be screwed if I don't do my best to\find it.
[Kojiroh] It's pretty empty around this port at\dawn.
[Kojiroh] Or so I thought... More and more people\show up, but they aren't fishermen.
[Kojiroh] It's quiet up on the boat... Just the way\I like it.
[Kojiroh] That's a big cruise ship.
[Kojiroh] They'd never know if I sneaked in\there...
[Kojiroh] It's smaller than I thought.
[Kojiroh] A luxury liner would be about 500 meters\long...
[Kojiroh] ...But then again, maybe not.
[Kojiroh] The ocean is so magnificent, so grand.
[Kojiroh] I know there's all the crap about water\pollution, but this ocean is cleaner than crystal.
[Kojiroh] I wouldn't recommend drinking it, but it\looks pretty.
[Kojiroh] This is a rope... I could have some fun\in bed with this.
[Kojiroh] It's tight...
[Kojiroh] This could definitely hold a person...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] This thing is more of a steel wire than a\rope.
[Kojiroh] I guess it's necessary to hold a boat\with that much weight.
[Kojiroh] They're all over the boat...
[Kojiroh] The anchor is dropped to keep the boat\from floating away.
　Warehouse district

　Connect the rope
[Kojiroh] This seems to be the only way.
[Kojiroh] I can get up there in a minute.
[Kojiroh] Okay... Let's connect the rope.
The rope slides through my hands...
[Kojiroh] Alright...
[Kojiroh] This isn't going...so...
[Kojiroh] Just don't fall between the ship and the\wall.
[Kojiroh] And if that happens, I'll be crushed like\a pancake.
[Kojiroh] ...
I slide the rope through my hands.
[Kojiroh] Here goes... It's all over if I fall now.
[Kojiroh] Just a little more.
The rope feels hot inside my hands.
[Kojiroh] Great, now I can go inside.
[Voice] Hey! What's going on there!
[Kojiroh] Uh-oh... Someone on shore saw me.
[Voice] Hey someone's going in the boat!
[Kojiroh] Gotta move fast...
a029
[Kojiroh] I'll go back to the warehouse after I\settle everything.
[Kojiroh] I just got here.
[Kojiroh] First of all, what the hell did I come\here for?
[Kojiroh] There's no way up but using the rope.

[Kojiroh] It's my private detective office... I'll\be back there in a while.
[Kojiroh] There's my private detective office.
[Kojiroh] It's like I'm taking one last look at\it... Goodbye!
[Kojiroh] It's a boat belonging to the Republic of\Eldia.
[Kojiroh] Today, the commemoration will take place\on the boat.
[Kojiroh] The ship is called "Tristan," and Purins\on it.
[Kojiroh] I have to give her the fragments of the\National Seal...
[Kojiroh] I don't have anything to do there now.
[Kojiroh] Central Avrenue...

[Akane] You're going, aren't you?
[Kojiroh] Yeah.
[Akane] Mind if I wait here...?
[Kojiroh] I'm not restricting you from anything. If\I'm not back, feel free to take whatever you like.
[Akane] Don't talk like that!
[Kojiroh] I was only pulling your leg.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] Don't give me that look. Even if I was\serious, there's not much of mine to take!
[Akane] I'll throw everything away in the dump if\you don't come back.
[Kojiroh] I'll be back.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah... An assistant of mine might\come by today.
[Akane] An assistant...?
[Kojiroh] A girl with a ponytail. We might end up\partners, so listen to what she has to say.
[Akane] A...girl?
[Kojiroh] It ain't what you're thinking. Just\listen to what information she has.
[Akane] ...Fine.
[Kojiroh] See ya.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] At least I left on a good note.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I gotta be cool about doing this stuff. I\can't just walk around here nonchalantly.
[Kojiroh] I'm using illegal means to get what I\want, you know?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] The Tristan belongs to the Republic of\Eldia. Once it reaches international seas, it's out\of Japanese jurisdiction.
[Kojiroh] Which means, if I'm caught, I'll be\punished under Eldian law.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] But there's no way I could get the death\penalty for being a stowaway.
[Kojiroh] At least, I hope not.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I can see it.

[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] It sure is big... Whoa.
[Kojiroh] So, this is Tristan.

[Kojiroh] Kou is already dead.
[Kojiroh] I don't have any reason to go to his\house.

　About the embassy
　About "person"
　About the note
　About "Terror"
[Purin] The ones at the embassy have taken me in.\They protect me.
[Kojiroh] Oh...
[Kojiroh] (I must've read Mido all wrong.)
[Kojiroh] Do you know about the Eldian embassy?
[Purin] Yes.
[Kojiroh] They have your jacket there... The one I\gave you.
0295
0295e
[Purin] Yes, that's where I've been all this time.
[Kojiroh] I knew it!
[Purin] Why did you go there, Kojiroh?
[Kojiroh] I went there to rescue you... It was\dangerous, but I could handle it.
[Purin] The ones at the embassy have taken me in.\They protect me.
[Kojiroh] Protect you?
[Purin] Yes... Seeing as how there's a price on my\head, they figured it would be best for me to stay\with them for a while.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] They said to call the "person" so that I\can be picked up. But I can't...
[Kojiroh] Why not...?
[Purin] I've been told not to come back until I get\something from Kou.
[Kojiroh] So that's what they call\"protection"!?!?!
[Purin] No! I volunteered for this.
[Kojiroh] ...On your own?
[Purin] Yes...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] I wanted to contact you, but I didn't know\your telephone number.
[Kojiroh] Did you run away?
[Purin] I felt terribly sorry for Ambassador Mido,\but I couldn't tell him about you.
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah!
[Purin] Excuse me?
[Kojiroh] I know it's off the subject, but what\happened to my cash?
[Purin] Oh, that...
[Kojiroh] Ah, shit... Well, it happens.

[Purin] Ha ha... It's right here!

[Kojiroh] Hey! It's a pile of dough!
[Purin] I remembered to check all the pockets when\I took off my clothes.
[Kojiroh] Good job!
[Purin] Oh, it was nothing...
[Kojiroh] Well, now I don't have to worry about\money for a while.
0295
0295e
[Purin] I apologize... I forgot the jacket.
[Kojiroh] Ah, it was cheap shit anyway.
[Kojiroh] (So that's what all the commotion at the\embassy was last night...)
[Kojiroh] (But my thoughts about Mido were totally\wrong.)
[Purin] ...Someone will be the successor to the\Eldian throne.
[Kojiroh] The successor to the throne...
[Kojiroh] What kind of person will it be?
0295
0295e
[Purin] A noble person of the Eldian royal family.
[Kojiroh] No, no... I mean, what kind of\personality does the person have?
[Purin] Oh, very pure and kind. A person who can\relate to the common people.
[Kojiroh] ...But a dangerous someone still has\their eyes on you.
[Purin] I volunteered to be here...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] Is that strange?
[Kojiroh] Listen, Purin... I don't know whether or\not this was a good decision...
[Purin] I see...
[Kojiroh] What would you do if you had a brother or\sister who got involved in a dangerous situation?
[Purin] I would stop them.
[Kojiroh] Exactly... But would you stop them even\if they wanted to be in the situation?
[Purin] Yes.
[Kojiroh] Who's the person?
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] See, that person should do this on their\own.
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] The person stays in a safe place, and\uses another to do their dirty work... They're the\worst kind.
0295d
Purin gives me a hard look.
[Kojiroh] What's wrong?
[Purin] Please don't talk bad things about that\person.
[Kojiroh] You don't have to cry... Jeez.
[Purin] I like both of you just as much.
[Kojiroh] ...
0295
0295e
[Purin] Please?
[Kojiroh] Alright, I won't.
[Purin] I'm sorry for making all kinds of requests.
[Kojiroh] I would feel the same way if someone\talks bad about a person I like, too.
Purin nods.
[Kojiroh] So what position do they hold in society?
[Purin] I guess I can tell you... The successor to\the throne.
[Kojiroh] What! So, on a higher level than just the\royal family? You mean, the next ruler?
[Purin] Yes...
0295
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (I can't believe this is happening.)
[Purin] I'm sorry... I can't explain it very well.
[Kojiroh] I see...
[Kojiroh] There's something I want to show you,\Purin.
0295
0295e
[Purin] What could that be...?
[Kojiroh] It's the note Siria gave me... Do you\know her?
[Purin] No, I don't.
[Kojiroh] You don't?? Her hair is cut pretty short,\and she's got a great body with huge tits.
[Purin] Sorry, I've never seen her.
[Kojiroh] Hey, no reason to apologize... Where'd\the note go?
I scrounge around, looking for the note.
[Kojiroh] Here! It's just like a short poem.
[Purin] May I see it?
[Kojiroh] Here.
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] (I think it's some secret code...)
[Kojiroh] (The moon will be full, the oasis will\moisten, and green shall return to the desert.)
[Kojiroh] (Other than some secret code, what else\could it be?)
[Purin] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] Do you get it?
[Purin] Not at all.
[Kojiroh] Huh?!?!
[Purin] What does this mean?
[Kojiroh] Wait a minute... That's what I wanted to\ask you.
[Purin] Oh. Well, I don't understand this at all.
[Kojiroh] But...Kou wanted to give this to you. He\wanted you to have it.
[Purin] Kou?
[Kojiroh] (What the hell is she trying to pull\here?)
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] You don't understand this, eh?
[Purin] Nope. No matter how many times I read it, I\don't get it.
[Kojiroh] Don't be so disappointed... Maybe there's\a mistake somewhere.
[Purin] Yes...
[Kojiroh] (There's something fishy going on\here...)
[Kojiroh] (I don't think Siria was lying to me...)
[Kojiroh] (But why would Purin have to lie about\it...?)
[Kojiroh] (There must've been a mistake somewhere\along the way...)
[Kojiroh] (Purin doesn't seem to know about\"Terror.")
[Kojiroh] Does the name "Terror" ring a bell?
[Purin] I should hope not! No, I've never heard of\anyone like that.
[Kojiroh] No one at all?
[Purin] You mean, someone actually named their kid\"Terror"???
[Kojiroh] Ah, just forget I mentioned it.
[Purin] ...
　Purin
[Purin] Aren't you going to enter your office?
[Kojiroh] Why don't we take a trip somewhere...
0295
0295e
[Purin] Where?
[Kojiroh] To where the successor is...
[Purin] I can't. I was told not to.
[Kojiroh] Think logically. You don't even know what\you were suppose to get from Kou. And Kou, the\essential person here, doesn't even exist anymore.
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] You'll never be able to return to that\person.
[Purin] Yes... If this body rots away...
[Kojiroh] Now you just listen to me...
[Purin] Yes?
[Kojiroh] The successor to the throne needs you. Am\I right?
[Purin] You're right... They need me very badly.
[Kojiroh] So basically, if you just hang around\here doing nothing... you're royally screwing the\successor. They need you!
[Purin] I wouldn't say that I'm doing nothing...
[Kojiroh] The important thing here is that there's\a result.
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] No one ever said you weren't cooperating,\Purin. But you can't do any of this on your own.
[Purin] Yes...
[Kojiroh] Come on... Go in the direction of the\successor, and find out who she is. I'm trying to\help, can't you see?
[Purin] Well, that may be...
[Kojiroh] This mission requires your cooperation,\Purin. The world is calling for you. Be the best\you can be.
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] You may affect the course of a nation's\fate... I don't think it's wise to go against fate.\Trust me.
[Purin] Okay... You're right.
[Kojiroh] (I'm good. Damn good.)
[Kojiroh] (Well, I seemed to have persuaded her.)
[Purin] Will you please come with me, Kojiroh?
[Kojiroh] Of course. I'd love to meet your\guardians, the ones who protect you.
[Purin] Sure. I think you'll become great friends.
[Kojiroh] So where is it?
[Purin] The Princess Hotel. Room 1420.
[Kojiroh] Hold on...
[Purin] Yes?
[Kojiroh] Let's make sure no bounty hunters are\looking for you.
[Purin] Okay... But how...?
[Kojiroh] Spreading information. We'll say you were\captured, and then they won't be looking for you\anymore.
[Purin] Oh.
[Kojiroh] So we might have to make a phone call.
[Purin] A phone call?
[Kojiroh] Let's just go into my office for now.
[Purin] Okay.
[Purin] Please listen.
[Kojiroh] Alright.
[Purin] I'm forbidden to discuss this... You must\forget it as soon as I tell you about it.
[Kojiroh] Sure thing...
eve_05
[Purin] I'm serving the noble one who will succeed\to the throne.
[Kojiroh] The royal family member, right?
0295b
[Purin] You mean, you knew?
[Kojiroh] Sorry, I guess I'm good at spoiling a\good story. Go on.
0295
0295e
[Purin] And then... I was supposed to get some\goods from a man named Kou.
[Kojiroh] What kind of goods...?
[Purin] They won't tell me. I'm just supposed to\get them from Kou, and give them to the successor.
[Kojiroh] I see... So that's what your special job\is...
[Purin] And Kou chose this wharf as the place to\hand over the goods. But on the day we were to\meet, he didn't show up...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] I was at my wits' end. There was no sign of\Kou, and without the goods, I couldn't see the\successor... I had nowhere to go.
[Kojiroh] Now it's all making sense...
[Purin] So, I ultimately ended up using you... I\expect you to punish me any way you wish.
[Kojiroh] Hey, I could never do that...
0295
0295b
[Purin] You mean, you forgive me?
[Kojiroh] I'd never get angry at you for a thing\like that.
0295
0295d
[Purin] Oh, Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Oh, not again... Don't cry.
[Purin] Thank you so much! Thank you!
[Kojiroh] (Whew...)
0295
0295e
[Purin] My heart nearly stopped beating when I\heard that Kou died... I was in your room that\time.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] I was told never to go to Kou's house, but\I had to make sure it was true...
[Kojiroh] So that's when I saw you talking to the\cops.
[Purin] Yes... Kou was already dead.
[Kojiroh] I remember.
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] You wouldn't mind if I asked you a few\questions, would you?
0295
[Purin] Go ahead.
[Kojiroh] Don't answer if you don't want to... Just\answer whatever you can.
[Purin] I'll consider the questions very carefully.
[Purin] ...I want to go back...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] I long for my old home...
[Kojiroh] Well, can you go back?
[Purin] Yes... But ever since meeting you, I have\never wanted to leave.
[Kojiroh] It doesn't have anything to do with\money, does it?
0295e
[Purin] No, nothing with money.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] There aren't words to describe the\gratitude I feel towards you.
[Kojiroh] Hey, you're embarrassing me! By the way,\what are your protective guardians doing for you?
[Purin] The successor...
[Kojiroh] The...successor?
0295
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] (What the hell is she trying to tell me?)
[Purin] I am...
[Kojiroh] Come on, spit it out...
0295
0295d
[Purin] Oh, Kojiroh... What should I do?
[Kojiroh] I can't help you unless you tell me\what's going on...
[Purin] Oh... How can I ever leave this sadness...
0295
[Kojiroh] (Purin...)
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] Come on!
[Purin] Excuse me?
[Kojiroh] Go for it! You can do it.
[Purin] You think so?
[Kojiroh] People have to go out and grab their\happiness.
Purin nods.
[Kojiroh] I know you can do it. You can be happy.
[Purin] Oh, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] Are you feeling better now?
0295c
[Purin] Yes!
[Kojiroh] Mind if I ask a question?
[Purin] Sure...
[Kojiroh] Do you trust me?
[Purin] Of course... You rescued me from those\dirty punks that time.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] And you gave me a place to stay when I had\nowhere to go... I can never thank you enough...
[Kojiroh] I see.
[Purin] I know... I know what you want to say...
[Kojiroh] Oh...

[Purin] I already know.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Damn... And I had a mountain of\questions ready to ask.)
[Kojiroh] (I can't say anything when the person is\standing right in front of me.)
[Kojiroh] (Where should I begin the conversation\from...?)
[Purin] But it's such a beautiful place.
[Kojiroh] Hm..?
[Purin] The place, it's quite splendid.
[Kojiroh] Where is?
[Purin] Here.
[Kojiroh] You're the first one to ever call this\place splendid.
[Purin] It reminds me of my hometown...
[Kojiroh] It does...?
[Purin] Yes... My birthplace.
[Kojiroh] So, you could see the ocean.
[Purin] Well, yes... An ocean of desert.
[Kojiroh] Desert?
[Purin] The nights were blue... I could hear the\sound of waves off in the distance.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] The place gave me an understanding of all\things... The depth and pureness of eternity...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] I must sound crazy to you...
[Kojiroh] It takes me a few joints to reach that\level of understanding, but I don't think you're\crazy...
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] (Purin...)
　Surroundings
　Purin
　Hair
　Ocean
[Kojiroh] (It's such a nice, quiet wharf...)
[Kojiroh] (I can hear her breathing...)
[Purin] It's so still, and beautiful... I love this\place.
[Kojiroh] You're the first one to ever say that,\too...
[Kojiroh] (Purin and I are the only ones here...)
[Kojiroh] (I can hear the waves washing against the\wharf...)
[Kojiroh] (I've never been so relaxed...)
[Kojiroh] (I should apologize for all the shit I\put her through in the beginning.)
[Kojiroh] (I would like to help her right now.)
[Kojiroh] (I wonder why...)
[Kojiroh] (Her eyes are blue and gold, shimmering\under the moonlight...)
[Kojiroh] (Can I really help her?)
[Kojiroh] (Her hair flows like the golden rivers of\California...)
[Kojiroh] (Such beautiful hair...)
[Kojiroh] (The curling waves are so cute... How\they flow from her head!)
[Kojiroh] (The gold is illuminated under the\moonlight...)
[Kojiroh] (How beautiful her hair is...)
[Kojiroh] (It's the port... Purins staring out at\the sea in loneliness.)
[Purin] I wonder how far I'd have to travel across\this ocean to get to my country.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] It's a beautiful ocean, isn't it?
[Kojiroh] Harbors like these are never very\beautiful.
[Purin] But the moonlight on the night sea...
[Kojiroh] Well, maybe then it's beautiful.
　Inside the office
　Inside the ocean
[Kojiroh] Okay, let's go inside the office.
[Purin] Okay.

[Kojiroh] (Let's listen to what Purin has to say.)
[Kojiroh] (Not now...)
[Kojiroh] (I want to hear what Purin has to say...)
[Kojiroh] Splash!
[Kojiroh] Satisfied? I ain't jumping in no ocean.
[Kojiroh] Okay...
[Purin] Um... Why, may I ask, are you undressing?
[Kojiroh] Ha ha ha... Ice swimming is a hobby of\mine.
[Purin] I see...
[Kojiroh] ...Stop that.
　Look/Investigate
　Move
　Sit
　Box
　Air
[Kojiroh] Do I feel a special attachment to the box\or something?
[Kojiroh] Forget about it. There is no time to rest\my ass on some box.
[Kojiroh] I've got more important things to do.
[Kojiroh] I said forget about it.
[Kojiroh] Isn't there something else I should be\doing?
[Kojiroh] I'm too tired for that now.
　Surroundings
　Detective office
　Boat
　Buildings
[Kojiroh] I'm looking around, but I don't see Purin\anywhere.
[Kojiroh] I'm used to this scene... Nothing's\changed.
[Kojiroh] It's my damned private detective office!
[Kojiroh] Nobody will ever notice there's a\detective office here...
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] I wonder what country owns that boat...\Ah, who cares.
[Kojiroh] It's still anchored there...
[Kojiroh] How long are they gonna leave it there??
[Kojiroh] It's Central Avenue... Shall we go?
[Kojiroh] Central Avenue is over there.
[Kojiroh] Perhaps Purin is wandering around there\like a lost puppy...
　Inside the office
　Central Avenue
　Kou's house
　International school
[Kojiroh] Back to the office...?
a001_7
[Kojiroh] Inside the office...? Don't I have\somewhere else to go?
[Kojiroh] Fine, whatever you want.
a001_7
[Kojiroh] Huh? Back there again?
[Kojiroh] I don't think there have been any\developments in the past minute.
a001_5
[Kojiroh] Well, maybe there could be something.
[Kojiroh] Let's go in the office.
a001_5
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah, maybe Kyoko's back.
[Kojiroh] Let's go inside!
a001_5
[Kojiroh] Sure, let's go back to my office.
a001_5
[Kojiroh] Huh? I just got out here...
[Kojiroh] Ah, hell. I'll go back in...
a001_5
[Kojiroh] It's off to Central Avenue!
a007
[Kojiroh] I'm still pretty interested in Kou, that\fat-ass.
[Kojiroh] Kyoko should be waiting for me...
[Kojiroh] ...Maybe that's just wishful thinking.
[Kojiroh] Okay, it's off to Central Avenue!
a007
[Kojiroh] Central Avenue...? Okay. Let's go.
a007
[Kojiroh] Hey, I might as well go inside if I've\come this far.
[Kojiroh] There's something I have to speak to\Kyoko about.
[Kojiroh] Central Avenue...? Okay. Let's go.
a007
[Kojiroh] Kou's house?
[Kojiroh] I don't think that's where I'm supposed\to go.
a010_2
[Kojiroh] Kou's house, huh? Well, maybe Purin's\there.
a010_2
[Kojiroh] I'd better get in the office... I\promised Kyoko I'd meet her.
[Kojiroh] I think there's just a cop standing guard\there.
a010_2
[Kojiroh] Let's go over to the international\school.
a014_2
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah, I'm supposed to meet Kyoko in\front of the international school.
[Kojiroh] But I am interested in Kou's decoy.
[Kojiroh] Anyway, let's go.
a014_2
[Kojiroh] We're going to the international school,\right?
a014_2
[Kojiroh] I just came from there, didn't I?
[Kojiroh] I don't want to back there...
[Kojiroh] The international school...? Let's go.
