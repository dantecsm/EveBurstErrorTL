[Kojiroh] So... The case has begun. I'll solve it\first.
[Yayoi] We don't intend to lose, either...
[Kojiroh] Yeah, yeah...
[Yayoi] You think he's after the insurance money?\Maybe...
[Kojiroh] I don't know... The clues were so...\Obvious.
[Yayoi] Obvious?
[Kojiroh] Yeah... It's like they were left there to\be found.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] And I have a feeling that Kou really\wants that painting back.
[Yayoi] But didn't you just say that sounded too\contrived?
[Kojiroh] Yeah, so that's the problem. He wants the\painting back, but he's trying to make it look like\a robbery.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] I think if you can find out why he wants\the painting back, you have the case solved.
[Yayoi] Can you be sure?
[Kojiroh] No, I'm not so sure, but I do have a\pretty good hunch. I just don't think we should\label this a theft.
[Yayoi] ...
[Yayoi] I listened to both you and Nikaido... And I\thought of something.
[Kojiroh] What?
[Yayoi] You're still good.
[Kojiroh] That's an overstatement.
[Yayoi] You already found something, didn't you?
[Kojiroh] Not at all.
[Yayoi] So, a company secret, eh?
[Kojiroh] No. I'm being totally honest with you.
[Yayoi] I wonder...
[Kojiroh] I just got the case today, didn't I?
[Yayoi] I'm just surprised. For once, Kojiroh\doesn't know what's going on...
[Kojiroh] But there are a few things I find very\interesting.
[Yayoi] Like what?
[Kojiroh] I think you know what they are.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] The dirt on the window sill.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] But it's not the same kind of theft\Nikaido's thinking of.
[Yayoi] I see...
[Kojiroh] It's just an intuition... But it might\have been a professional job.
[Yayoi] That's what Nikaido thinks.
[Kojiroh] Was a burglar alarm installed in the\house?
[Yayoi] There should've been... According to the\police, alarms are installed in every house\throughout the neighborhood.
[Kojiroh] Then Nikaido might be right.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] They entered the house, took the item\they wanted, and left everything else untouched.
[Yayoi] When you put it that way, it seems\consistent...
[Kojiroh] But then...
[Yayoi] But they left behind too many clues.
[Kojiroh] That's right. It's like they want to make\it look like a robbery.
[Yayoi] I see... So perhaps Kou is trying to trick\everyone.
[Kojiroh] Well, only if he had lots of insurance on\the painting...
[Yayoi] Oh, insurance...
[Kojiroh] The reason why I just walked out wasn't\because I was pissed.
[Yayoi] Really?
[Kojiroh] Of course. By going there, the\investigation would never get anywhere, anyway.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] You know how I am, don't you? I don't\like wasting my time.
[Yayoi] Fine. If that's what you say, I believe\you.
[Kojiroh] Got it?
[Yayoi] But I want to make it up.
[Kojiroh] Don't worry about it.
[Yayoi] No, I have to... Because it's you.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] I want to apologize as the head of the\Katsuragi Private Detective Offices. My workers'\mistakes are my mistakes.
[Kojiroh] Alright, alright. But don't worry about\it... You don't need to aplogize.
[Yayoi] That helps a lot.
[Kojiroh] (I just want to settle this once and for\all...)
[Kojiroh] (Huh? Why the hell am I so\frustrated...?)
[Yayoi] Well, sorry I shouted at you to get your\attention...
[Kojiroh] I couldn't care less. What's your\business?
[Yayoi] It's about your conversation with\Nikaido...
[Kojiroh] What about it?
[Yayoi] I heard almost everything that was said.
[Kojiroh] Yeah? So what?
[Yayoi] He said some pretty bad things to you...
[Kojiroh] Oh, that... Like I give a shit.
[Yayoi] ...

[Kojiroh] I'm in front of the Katsuragi Private\Detective Offices.
[Kojiroh] Let's have a word with Yayoi.
[Kojiroh] Katsuragi Private Detective Offices...\Yayoi's right in front of me.
[Yayoi] Sorry for getting your attention like\this...
[Kojiroh] (Yayoi seems restless... I wonder what's\getting at her.)
[Kojiroh] (She just called out to me... What could\she want?)
[Kojiroh] (Forget about the cigarettes, man! Let's\listen to what she has to say.)
[Kojiroh] (She smokes a lot more now...)
[Kojiroh] (It's her habit... And there must be\something really important.)
　Katsuragi Offices
　Central Avenue
[Kojiroh] I probably shouldn't go there today.
[Kojiroh] Again? I just came out from there.
[Kojiroh] And that Nikaido might charge at me\again.
[Kojiroh] I'll talk to Yayoi a bit more.
[Kojiroh] I'd like to return to Central Avenue,\but...
[Kojiroh] Yayoi's right in front of me.
[Kojiroh] And I can't just leave her here.

[Kojiroh] I can't possibly stand on the wall, man.
[Kojiroh] I might be able to, after taking a\hallucinogenic... But I doubt it.
[Kojiroh] Wow... I must be getting smarter.
[Kojiroh] I'd love to just run up the side of a\building like Spiderman, but I was\institutionalized for that twice already.
[Kojiroh] Okay! Let's walk up the wall like\Spiderman!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] There's no point in lying down.
[Kojiroh] Forget about this madness... I have my\limits, you know?
[Kojiroh] Back in the old days, they called me\"Kojiroh the tree climber."
[Kojiroh] I hope I still got it.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] My hand hurts too much for that.

　Directory
　Shrubbery
[Kojiroh] This financial district is very quiet...
[Kojiroh] I'm on a side-street off Central\Avenue...
[Kojiroh] It's pretty quiet for a financial\district...
[Kojiroh] The Katsuragi Private Detective Offices\are in this building.
[Kojiroh] I didn't really want to come here, you\know...
[Kojiroh] The building's windows are large,\designed to take in lots of light.
[Kojiroh] But all the offices have blinds pulled\down to block the light out. Why is humanity full\of these contradictions?
[Kojiroh] Well, I guess it's all for looks... We\need windows, even if we don't need to see through\them.
[Kojiroh] I have to admit... Even on the hottest\summer night, I need a blanket covering me.
[Kojiroh] There's nothing on the sixth floor...
[Kojiroh] And that's because this building is only\five stories high...
[Kojiroh] On the fifth floor is... "Warehouse"??
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] But is it normal to write "Warehouse" on\a directory?
[Kojiroh] But perhaps "Warehouse" is the name of a\company.
[Kojiroh] But... So what?
[Kojiroh] Well, well... What's on the fourth\floor...
[Kojiroh] "Stop Organized Crime! Sponsored by\Norton Crime Watch."
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] We need more groups like that around.
[Kojiroh] What's on the first floor? Just boring\old offices...
[Kojiroh] What else is there...
[Kojiroh] "The Shimmering Light Religious Group" is\on the second floor... I think I'll stay away from\that one.
[Kojiroh] The directory tells me which office is on\which floor.
[Kojiroh] According to this, Katsuragi's detective\office is on the third floor.
[Kojiroh] But I know which floor it's on... No need\to look at this thing.
[Kojiroh] They're just bushes... Green is supposed\to relax the eye.
[Kojiroh] And nothing relaxes me more than a pile\of green cash in the palm of my hand.
[Kojiroh] But then, maybe it excites me, too.\Viagra is green.

[Kojiroh] You wanna go to Katsuragi Private\Detective Offices?
[Kojiroh] I'm not too enthused about the idea...
