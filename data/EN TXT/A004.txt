[Kojiroh] Huh? Guess it was no one...

[Man at copier] Uh, she just went to the bank.
[Man at desk] Oh yeah, that's the ticket... She\went to the bank...

The telephone rings.
[Man at desk] Answer the phone, Keiko!
She picks it up.
[Keiko] Hello, this is the Katsuragi Private\Detective Offices.
[Keiko] No, that article is a lie. No, it's not\true...
There's a man making a whole bunch of copies.
[Man at copier] This is hard work.
[Man at copier] I need to get paid more, to keep\this up.
The phone rings.
[Man at desk] Oh... Keiko's on the phone right now.
[Man at desk] I guess I'll have to answer it.
The putz at the desk answers the phone.
[Man at desk] Hello, Katsuragi offices...
[Man at desk] No, we don't do interviews.

[Kojiroh] Things are getting crazy around here...

[Kojiroh] Hello.
[Man at desk] Looks like you did it this time, Mr.\Amagi.
[Kojiroh] Did what?
[Man at desk] You found the painting, didn't you...
[Kojiroh] Well, yeah...
[Man at desk] Good job!
[Kojiroh] Yeah, yeah.
[Man at desk] You're amazing, Mr. Amagi...
[Kojiroh] What...
[Man at desk] ...

[Yayoi] What are you here for, Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Hmm.
[Yayoi] You want to see what we're up to here? Is\that it?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] I heard about it. You found the painting\already...
[Kojiroh] That's right.
[Yayoi] We've been working on it for days... And\you solve it in a day...
[Kojiroh] It's a coincidence. That's what Nikaido\told me.
[Yayoi] A coincidence? How modest.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (...I knew I shouldn't have come here.)
[Yayoi] Will you take care of the place while I'm\gone.
[Man at desk] Yes, Chief.
[Kojiroh] Are you going somewhere?
[Yayoi] Yes. I was on my way out to meet an old\friend.
[Kojiroh] Then let me take you part of the way.
[Yayoi] No thanks.
[Kojiroh] ...Fine.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] Well, see you around.
[Yayoi] Good luck, Kojiroh.

[Kojiroh] (It's Yayoi...)

[Man at desk] Oh, good evening Mr. Amagi.
[Kojiroh] Look who's here...

[Kojiroh] Hey babe! Miss me?
[Man at desk] Oh, Mr. Amagi.

[Kojiroh] ...Oh.

[Kojiroh] Uhh... I have a pizza here, no\anchovies...
[Man at desk] Huh? I never ordered any pizza! ...\Oh, Mr. Amagi!
[Kojiroh] Hey what's up?
[Man at desk] I'm fine, how are you?
[Kojiroh] Look at me when you're talking to me,\boy.
[Man at desk] Actually, I'm too busy to look up\right now.
[Kojiroh] What, are you setting up dominoes?
[Man's voice] Hey, dammit!
[Kojiroh] Who the hell is shouting like that...?

[Nikaido] I can shout if I want to!
[Kojiroh] Hey, I came just as you told me to.
[Nikaido] I never told you to come...Hey you there,\don't talk to this guy.
[Man] I'm sorry.
[Kojiroh] Hey Nerdo, you're such an idiot.

[Kojiroh] Not in here.
[Kojiroh] It's a good thing she wasn't in there...\She'd murder me if I saw her taking a crap!
[Kojiroh] But it's strange that Yayoi, the head\Chief, isn't around.
[Kojiroh] They mentioned something about the bank,\but jeez...
[Kojiroh] Where did everyone go?
[Kojiroh] All of a sudden, this place is completely\empty.
[Kojiroh] The desk is so neat and orderly...
[Kojiroh] This is the cleanest I've ever seen it...
[Kojiroh] Did these employees suddenly take\cleaning lessons?
[Kojiroh] The heater is off... There's no reason to\use it now anyway.
[Kojiroh] The heater is off...
[Kojiroh] They're saving energy by not being here,\but that couldn't be the reason...
[Kojiroh] But why the hell isn't anyone here?
[Kojiroh] It's even clean around the copy machine\area.
[Kojiroh] The copier is turned off...
[Kojiroh] What happened to that guy who is always\making copies...?

[Kojiroh] Night or day, the Katsuragi Private\Detective Offices never change.
[Kojiroh] There's a strange atmosphere here now...
[Kojiroh] Everyone's working hard... Or, so it\seems.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Everyone appears to have their own\tasks...
[Kojiroh] But there's something weird about this.
[Kojiroh] The heater... It conditions the air.
[Kojiroh] Then again, so does my anus when I blow\wind...
[Kojiroh] What a boring table... They should get\rid of this thing.
[Kojiroh] It must be where the employees hang out\during breaks.

[Yayoi] You seem shocked.
[Kojiroh] Well, I am. But that's...
[Yayoi] I told the police.
[Kojiroh] Well, what happened?
[Yayoi] Everything's going wrong... They say we\were hired by Kou, not that fat guy.
[Kojiroh] Testify... I'll testify.
[Yayoi] Don't bother... We have no proof.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] We got totally nailed.
[Kojiroh] Look, all we have to do is find that\phony Kou.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] Oh, wait. Even if we do find him... He\just has to bluff and we're finished.
[Yayoi] He's taken it this far... He probably wiped\away all his fingerprints and took everything that\could lead us to him.
[Kojiroh] Probably...
[Yayoi] And Nikaido's fingerprints are all over the\knife. It's over...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Come to think of it, there were a lot of\things that just seemed wrong.)
[Kojiroh] (I should think it over again.)
[Yayoi] I can't believe the nerve of that guy.
[Kojiroh] Is that guy...Nikaido?
[Yayoi] No. Our client, the fat ass guy with narrow\eyes.
[Kojiroh] Oh, you mean Kou. What's your problem\with him?
[Yayoi] ...? You mean, you haven't seen the news?
[Kojiroh] Well... I only heard about this case\through Akane.
[Yayoi] Keiko, bring me the morning paper.
[Keiko] Here you are...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Take a look at this.

I take the paper.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] "Early yesterday morning, on December 4,\the principal of Yale International School, 35 year\old Kou Stoleman's body was found in his home..."
[Kojiroh] "...Shin Nikaido is wanted for murder..."
[Yayoi] Well?
[Kojiroh] What the hell? It says that Kou's dead.
[Yayoi] Exactly. He is dead.
[Kojiroh] But look at the picture... The dead\dude's got glasses...
[Yayoi] Yeah... And the REAL Kou...
[Kojiroh] So who was that fat guy?
[Yayoi] I don't know.
[Kojiroh] ...!?!
[Yayoi] See. We got our asses wiped.
[Kojiroh] So that guy we've been calling "Kou,"\is...
[Yayoi] Somebody else.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (What the hell...?)
[Kojiroh] (That fat guy isn't Kou...!)
[Kojiroh] (So... So what the hell is my case\about???)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Have you lost some weight?
[Yayoi] Yes... Since I've been so busy...dieting.
[Kojiroh] What's this thing with Nikaido all about?
[Yayoi] Well, our phones and faxes have been going\nonstop since this morning.
[Kojiroh] ...It looks that way.
[Yayoi] I even considered closing the office for\the day. But all my clients have been barging in\here...
[Kojiroh] Why?
[Yayoi] Most of them wanted to cancel their cases.
[Kojiroh] What for?
[Yayoi] Why else? Because they think there's a\murderer working in this office!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Plus, I get a whole bunch of calls asking\for interviews.
[Kojiroh] Damn paparazzi...
[Yayoi] They wanted me to ask Nikaido to turn\himself in on the air... Crying.
[Kojiroh] They just want a story, don't listen to\them.
[Yayoi] But they pay well... Honestly, I thought\about it.
[Kojiroh] Why don't you take a little break.
[Yayoi] Everyone's working their asses off and you\want me to take a break!?
[Kojiroh] But you haven't been getting any sleep\lately, have you?
[Yayoi] I run this place... If it means I don't\sleep, I don't sleep.

[Kojiroh] Yeah?

[Yayoi] One day?!?
[Kojiroh] To be specific, it was gone by the\afternoon. I only enjoyed it for a moment.
[Yayoi] You spent it all!?
[Kojiroh] Hell no. My secretary paid off the bill\collectors.

[Yayoi] If you got the hots for her, I'll give you\her number.
[Kojiroh] For cryin' out loud, woman! I'm being\serious here.
[Yayoi] What about her?
[Kojiroh] How do you know her?
[Yayoi] She's an old friend.
[Kojiroh] I see... What exactly does she do?
[Yayoi] Why do you ask?
[Kojiroh] I'm just curious.
[Yayoi] Then why don't you just ask her yourself?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (I know she's hiding something...)

[Yayoi] I don't need your help, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] Maybe you're right.
[Yayoi] What's the matter with you, all of sudden?
[Kojiroh] Nothing... Hey, you talked to Nikaido,\right?
[Yayoi] Yeah...
[Kojiroh] Did you tell him?
[Yayoi] Tell him what?
[Kojiroh] The things you were saying this\afternoon... That he was on a different case...
[Yayoi] Oh that...
[Kojiroh] What happened?
[Yayoi] Everything's okay now. I gave him\permission.

[Nikaido] What are you doing here! How long have\you been listening?
[Kojiroh] Uhh... I just got here a second ago...
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] I can leave if I'm in the way...
[Nikaido] Did you see us... Um, did you see me try\to...
[Kojiroh] I took a peek, yeah.
[Nikaido] Good. Now you know... She's forgotten all\about you.
[Kojiroh] As I remember it... She refused your\ass... Didn't she?
[Nikaido] Shut up!!
[Kojiroh] Ha ha...
[Nikaido] The Chief is almost mine. And with her,\I'll be the new Chief around here.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Nikaido] Just you watch... I'm the one who'll\rebuild this detective agency...

[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Hmm... I've had enough of this running\around for today.
[Yayoi's voice] Nikaido? Is someone there?
[Kojiroh] (I'm doomed...)
[Yayoi's voice] Is anyone...there?
[Kojiroh] Let me tell you about our savior, Lord\Buddha.
[Yayoi's voice] Kojiroh!
[Kojiroh] Sorry.
[Yayoi's voice] Why are you here...
[Kojiroh] Here, let me explain...
[Yayoi's voice] Hold on a second... Just wait\there.
[Kojiroh] I'm waiting.
[Kojiroh] (I must be a complete idiot...)
[Kojiroh] (But she already knows that by now...)
[Kojiroh] (Why am I so crazy about women...?!)
[Yayoi's voice] So...sorry.

[Kojiroh] Maybe I'm hearing things...
There're more noises from the back.
[Kojiroh] I hear something coming from over\there... What could it be?
[Kojiroh] All the employees must be gone...
[Kojiroh] Yayoi isn't here either, I guess...
[Kojiroh] Which means they left the door\unlocked... This place has poor security.
[Kojiroh] I've seen these plants a million times.\They're all the same.
[Kojiroh] They're just plants... Nothing special.
[Kojiroh] The heater is on, but I don't see any\employees around.
[Kojiroh] The heater is on... But where have all\the employees gone?
[Kojiroh] This must be where the employees hang out\during breaks.
[Kojiroh] Of course, no one would be hiding down\there.

[Man at desk] The Chief...?
[Man at desk] She said she was going out to meet an\old friend...
[Man at desk] Do you have a message to give her?
[Man at desk] Hmm...
[Man at desk] Your office is so well known now, Mr.\Amagi...
[Man at copier] I'm almost finished with these...
[Man at copier] Once I finish these copies, I'll go\grab a beer.
[Man at copier] The condition of this office is\getting quite serious...
[Man at copier] The last Chief was arrested...
[Man at copier] And then Mr. Amagi took off to\start up his own business...
[Man at copier] Our new Chief, Yayoi, is busting\her ass here, but it may not be enough.
[Man at copier] Please don't tell her I said\anything...
[Keiko] I think I'm gonna change jobs soon...
[Keiko] I'd love a job where I just sit on my ass,\flirt with rich men, and make a few thousand\dollars every month.
[Keiko] Please, Mr. Amagi... Don't give me such a\dirty look.
[Keiko] I mean, I've gotta think about my future...

[Kojiroh] You mean, like a clown?
[Yayoi] You fool.
[Kojiroh] Hey, lighten up, will ya?
[Yayoi] What cold eyes you have...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] He's dead. You know that, right?
[Kojiroh] What!?!
[Yayoi] You mean, no one told you?
[Kojiroh] Never.
[Yayoi] Well, there was a fire at the prison\several days ago. He was burned to death.
[Kojiroh] ...?!
[Kojiroh] (My God...)
[Kojiroh] (Akane mentioned the fire... Could this\be it?)
[Yayoi] I'm too busy to cry for him... Maybe I'll\get a chance at the funeral.
[Kojiroh] (The old boss... He's dead.)
[Yayoi] But I can't cry. There's no time to cry.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] You look shocked.
[Kojiroh] Of course! He was like a father to me...
[Yayoi] I know... Were you ever aware of how\jealous I was?
[Kojiroh] Jealous of whom?
[Yayoi] I was jealous because you two were so\close.
[Kojiroh] Hey, we weren't THAT close...
[Yayoi] You sure?
[Kojiroh] You could never stay away from your\daddy.
[Yayoi] Well...
[Kojiroh] You know it's true.
[Yayoi] I know. I always loved my father... And we\always felt as if you were family.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] But now everything's changed.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] Let's not discuss this anymore.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] This isn't gonna do us any good.
[Yayoi] Oh...
[Kojiroh] But let me tell you something. I'm ever\grateful to him... And I still respect him.
[Yayoi] Then why did you do it?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] I guess you had to... He broke the law...
[Kojiroh]...
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Sorry, but would you mind leaving? I've got\work to do.
[Kojiroh] Sure, we talked a bit longer than\necessary.
[Yayoi] ...
[Yayoi] Ha ha...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] You haven't changed a bit...
[Kojiroh] Huh...?
[Yayoi] I was just saying that you haven't changed\much.
[Kojiroh] Oh. Well, I try not to.
[Yayoi] Sometimes you give me the chills.
[Kojiroh] Really?
[Yayoi] Yes. Just a minute ago you were looking\right through me, off into the distance.
[Kojiroh] That's not true... I just look funny\sometimes, that's all.
[Yayoi] Don't make that clown face!
[Kojiroh] I'm not only a clown, you know. I can\make lots of other faces, too.
[Yayoi] Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Ah, come on. I'm just trying to have a\little fun.
[Yayoi] I can tell, Kojiroh. Your heart is never\here... You're always so far away...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] I'm beginning to think that this isn't a\simple robbery.
[Kojiroh] Really, Katsuragi Offices think so too,\eh?
[Yayoi] Yeah, but it's all up to Nikaido.
[Kojiroh] Well, he may be competent, but he's a\complete idiot.
[Yayoi] Once again you're judging someone, and\you've lost sight of reality.
[Kojiroh] On the contrary, my dear.
[Yayoi] You're too flexible, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] I've got a stiff part as well. Wanna see\it?
[Yayoi] No thanks. That'd require a microscope.
[Kojiroh] You never complained about that before.
[Yayoi] No one can figure you out. There are no\guide books to follow.
[Kojiroh] Need a manual, eh?
[Yayoi] Oh yeah...
[Kojiroh] Everyone should run an investigation\efficiently and rationally. Is that it?
[Yayoi] There aren't enough people with your\ability as a detective. You've got instinct.
[Kojiroh] Instinct? Are you implying that I'm an\animal?
[Yayoi] Something like that.
[Kojiroh] There are many ways to run an\investigation. Give it some thought and you'll come\up with a dozen.
[Yayoi] That's what I mean when I say you're too\flexible.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] You, and my father, are the only ones I\ever knew with such talent.
[Kojiroh] Perhaps I'm his illegitimate son.
[Yayoi] He was MY father, and he ran this office.
[Kojiroh] I know.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] Yayoi, I really...
[Yayoi] Gimme a break. I don't think the word\"compassion" is in your vocabulary.
[Kojiroh] Well, you're right.
[Kojiroh] (Damn, what was I going to say to her...)
[Kojiroh] (I left this office, remember?)
[Kojiroh] (There's nothing I can do for her right\now.)
[Kojiroh] (Hmm...)
[Kojiroh] (But what if...)
[Kojiroh] (...Yeah.)
[Yayoi] Can I ask one thing?
[Kojiroh] You should know the size of my prick by\now.
[Yayoi] Don't talk like that to me, please.
[Kojiroh] Fine. What is it?
[Yayoi] I don't know if I should be asking this to\a competitor, but...
[Kojiroh] Oh, yes. My first time... It was August,\and so humid.
[Yayoi] I'm referring to the investigation. Is\there any progress?
[Kojiroh] None whatsoever.
[Yayoi] Are you getting desperate?
[Kojiroh] No way.
[Yayoi] So, you're being modest for once.
[Kojiroh] Modesty is a word that doesn't exist in\my vocabulary. I'd tell you if I was making\progress.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] In fact, I haven't a clue.
[Yayoi] This is awfully strange.
[Kojiroh] I swear to God.
[Yayoi] You're an atheist, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] Oh, that's right.
[Yayoi] Oh, well... I believe you.
[Kojiroh] Good, now just relax.
[Yayoi] It's so scary that when I'm with you, I\feel more... Relaxed.
[Kojiroh] (What does she mean by that...?)
[Kojiroh] (This conversation isn't getting\anywhere...)
[Kojiroh] (Something's not right.)
[Kojiroh] By the way...
[Yayoi] What now.
[Kojiroh] This office...
[Yayoi] What about this office?
[Kojiroh] Nothing. Forget it.
[Kojiroh] (I can't just ask her why she's going\broke.)
[Kojiroh] (...)
[Kojiroh] (But then...)
[Kojiroh] (Why the hell should I care about how\this office is doing?)
[Kojiroh] (I've already left this place. It's no\longer my concern.)
[Yayoi] You're acting strange.
[Kojiroh] Yeah... Maybe I'm just hungry. Yeah,\that's all.
[Kojiroh] You certainly are a workaholic... Working\this late into the night.
[Yayoi] I'm working too much. Everyone here works\so hard.
[Kojiroh] Why do you constantly overwork yourself?
[Yayoi] Because I don't finish my work during\business hours.
[Kojiroh] Why not?
[Yayoi] There's just too much.
[Kojiroh] Why do you accept such a workload?
[Yayoi] I need it. It's necessary.
[Kojiroh] You're so unreasonable.
[Yayoi] As are you.
[Kojiroh] Do you enjoy this?
[Yayoi] Whether I enjoy it or not isn't the issue.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, yeah.
[Yayoi] What are you talking about.
[Kojiroh] Nothing.
[Yayoi] Either way, I'm the boss. I have to support\my employees as best I can.
[Kojiroh] See, that's why you don't have a\boyfriend.
[Yayoi] I have no intention of getting one in the\near future, thank you.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] I have plans to meet an old friend today.

[Man at copier] I tried... And Nikaido just blew me\off.
[Man at copier] This is all I ever do...
[Keiko] Don't tell the Chief or Nikaido what I\said.
[Keiko] This office isn't as prosperous as it may\look...
[Keiko] That's because both you and the last Chief\are gone...
[Keiko] Now there's just Yayoi, and she works so\hard.
[Keiko] And Nikaido works pretty hard, too... But\he's nothing compared to how you were, Mr. Amagi...
[Kojiroh] Hey, that's Keiko... The one who answers\the phones.
[Keiko] Oh, Mr. Amagi!
[Keiko] Nikaido said some pretty rude things to\you, didn't he...
[Keiko] But I think you did the right thing.
[Keiko] Most of the employees here respect you, Mr.\Amagi.

[Kojiroh] This office is too damn bright for me,\dammit.
[Kojiroh] As always, everything here is so clean\and organized.
[Kojiroh] Yayoi used to come here so early, to\clean up... Could she still be doing that these\days?
[Kojiroh] But this office is very different from a\house.
[Kojiroh] The employees are busy typing, or working\with accounting papers...
[Kojiroh] They are busy working at their desks...\Doesn't sound THAT bad...
[Kojiroh] Investigators need to move around!
[Kojiroh] But that's the old way... Now we use our\heads.
[Kojiroh] But you don't get anywhere if you just\sit around...
[Kojiroh] It's circulating fresh air throughout the\room.
[Kojiroh] This part of the ceiling where it's kinda\low... This is where the heater is.
[Kojiroh] It was working so well last winter. So I\give it a punch and it became a freezer.
[Kojiroh] This must be where the employees hang out\during breaks.
[Kojiroh] Wobbly old chairs surround the ugly\table.
[Kojiroh] You make the clients sit on these so that\they'll feel insecure.
[Kojiroh] That's what I told Yayoi, and she flat\out denied it.
@Go outside
[Kojiroh] Let's go outside...
[Man at desk] Please come again... When Nikaido\isn't here.
[Kojiroh] God... He never looks this way.

[Kojiroh] Urghh!
[Nikaido] What the hell's the matter with you?
[Kojiroh] I think I'm gonna puke!!
[Nikaido] You fool!
[Kojiroh] Oh...man...! I'm gonna barf!!!
[Nikaido] Not here! Don't do it here!!!
[Kojiroh] I'm gonna barf here, man! Right here!
[Nikaido] Someone bring him a bucket! Quick!
[Kojiroh] (And when he's not looking...)
cI slip it right into his pocket.
[Kojiroh] (Too easy...)
[Kojiroh] (Well... I'm done.)
[Nikaido] You idiot! If you're gonna puke, puke\here!
[Kojiroh] Oh, I felt better as soon as I looked at\the bottom of the bucket.
[Nikaido] Damn you!
[Kojiroh] I've always had a thing for bucket\bottoms.
[Nikaido] Well, what made you want to throw up in\the first place?
[Kojiroh] Oh, I think it was your face. But I feel\much better now.
[Nikaido] You... You...
[Nikaido] You shitheeaaaddd!!
[Nikaido] That's it... Out! Out! Out!
[Kojiroh] Hey, hey. Calm down... Take a deep\breath... That's it.
@Nikaido
[Nikaido] I've had enough of your crap!
[Kojiroh] (Uh-oh... Things are getting out of hand\here. I'd better leave.)
[Nikaido] What the hell do you want?
[Kojiroh] Damn, you sound upset. Are you on your\period?
[Nikaido] No... I just lost something very\important... That's all.
[Kojiroh] (What an idiot...)
[Nikaido] Well? What the hell are you doing here?
[Kojiroh] I sure as hell didn't come here to take\this shit from you!
[Nikaido] Well, what DID you come here for, then?
[Kojiroh] (To return your stupid electronic\organizer.)
[Nikaido] What did you say?
[Kojiroh] Oh, just talking to myself.
[Nikaido] ...?
[Kojiroh] (I'm not getting anything done by being\here...)
[Kojiroh] (I'll just do what I came to do and go\home...)
[Nikaido] Or maybe you came here to eavesdrop for\more information! You damned leech!!!
[Kojiroh] How old are you?
[Nikaido] I've already found a clue you could never\even dream of...
[Kojiroh] Oh! And I bet you're just dying to tell\me about it...
[Nikaido] You idiot, I wouldn't dislose company\secrets to anyone like you.
[Kojiroh] Well, you're actually showing some signs\of common sense.
[Nikaido] But I'll give you a hint. Even though the\Chief forbids me to tell you everything.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Nikaido] With your tiny brain, you probably think\that it's just lost, right?
[Kojiroh] You mean, like the mud on the window\sill?
[Nikaido] How did you know about that?!?
[Kojiroh] (Whoopiee...)
[Nikaido] So, you heard from Kou, eh? You coward...\Do you want credit for that!?!
[Kojiroh] (This is no good...)
[Kojiroh] By the way, I haven't seen Yayoi around\here...
[Nikaido] She's arranging documents in the other\room.
[Kojiroh] Documents about this case?
[Nikaido] Unlike your mediocre office, we don't\deal with trivial cases...
[Kojiroh] It's not necessarily mediocre, but I get\your point...
[Kojiroh] (Yayoi and I made this office big,\idiot.)
[Nikaido] We have many cases that we have to deal\with.
[Kojiroh] Oh, so business is soaring!!!
[Nikaido] Where the hell are you going! You don't\have the right to hang around here!
[Kojiroh] You don't mind if I just jerk off in the\next room, do you?
[Nikaido] Dammit! What the hell are you talking\about! Of course I mind!
[Kojiroh] Damn.
[Nikaido] I have nothing to say to you.
[Kojiroh] Come on. Lighten up, Nikaido.
[Nikaido] It's Mr. Nikaido to you!
[Kojiroh] Why don't I just call you Mr. Fido?
[Nikaido] You son of a bitch!
[Kojiroh] Are you on medication, by any chance? I\know a good psychiatrist who could help you control\those outbursts.
[Nikaido] I get crazy whenever I speak to you.
[Kojiroh] Good, go with that. Now, tell me your\darkest fantasies.
[Nikaido] Are you trying to make a fool out of\me!?!
[Kojiroh] I'm only trying to help, Nikaido.
[Nikaido] I told you to call me Mr. Nikaido!
[Kojiroh] I'll call you whatever I damn well\please, Libido, now drop it!
[Nikaido] Wait'll I get my hands on you!

[Nikaido] I've had enough of your crap!
[Kojiroh] (Uh-oh... Things are getting out of hand\here. I'd better leave.)
[Kojiroh] God damn it... There's this big ass in\front of me and I can't see anything.
[Nikaido] What big ass?
[Kojiroh] This is Katsuragi Private Detective\Offices.
[Kojiroh] Business appears to be doing quite well.
[Nikaido] Ha ha ha... Thanks to me taking your\place! Don't stick your nose where it doesn't\belong.
[Nikaido] I've had enough of your crap!
[Kojiroh] (Uh-oh... Things are getting out of hand\here. I'd better leave.)
[Kojiroh] (Who cares...)
[Kojiroh] (Let's just get the job done and go.)
[Kojiroh] There's an idiot in front of me.
[Nikaido] What did you say!?
[Nikaido] I've had enough of your crap!
[Kojiroh] (Uh-oh... Things are getting out of hand\here. I'd better leave.)
[Kojiroh] Only if it can lift spirits...
[Kojiroh] But things just aren't going the right\way...
[Nikaido] What the hell are you talking about?
[Kojiroh] I incorporated these plants into the\office.
[Kojiroh] I thought it would bring peoples spirits\up.
[Nikaido] I don't like them. I'm gonna throw them\away as soon as I get permission from the Chief.
@Go outside
[Kojiroh] (Yeah... Let's go home.)
[Kojiroh] See ya later, Nikaido.
[Nikaido] Wait, fool! I have something to tell you.
[Kojiroh] What? That I'm a nice guy? I already know\that.
[Nikaido] Who the hell says that!
[Kojiroh] You.
[Nikaido] I don't know how you got this case from\Kou, but consider it your last one.
[Kojiroh] Is that so?
[Nikaido] After this case, you'll be begging for\change on the street...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Nikaido] Soon, no one will ever offer you any\cases.
[Kojiroh] I see...
[Nikaido] You don't even have a license anymore. I\have contacts who can keep it that way. I can have\your license permanently revoked.
[Kojiroh] Go ahead and try.
[Nikaido] This business isn't known for second\chances. You don't have a single ally. You're all\alone.
[Kojiroh] You're breaking my heart. Really.
[Nikaido] You're laughing now... But we'll see who\has the last laugh!!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Woman's voice] What was all that commotion!?!

[Nikaido] Chief...
[Yayoi] What's going on here, Nikaido...
[Nikaido] I was just talking with Kojiroh.
[Yayoi] Kojiroh, you're here...?
[Kojiroh] Well, I thought I'd drop in and say hi...
[Yayoi] You should've told me...
[Kojiroh] Nah, I gotta get going anyway...
[Nikaido] Chief! This guy is at it again...
[Yayoi] I'm in charge here, Nikaido.
[Nikaido] ...
[Yayoi] Come into this room, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] No thanks... I've done what I came to do.\See ya.
[Yayoi] Kojiroh!!!

[Kojiroh] Let's ditch this place and go home.
[Kojiroh] I came all this way.
[Kojiroh] I had something in mind, didn't I?
