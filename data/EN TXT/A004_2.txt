[Kojiroh] I came to have some fun.
[Yayoi] Get out!
[Kojiroh] Hey, you seemed pretty friendly\yesterday!
[Yayoi] Yeah and what the hell were you doing\today, huh!?
[Kojiroh] You're misunderstanding! That was...
[Yayoi] I have small breasts, and I'm more manly\than feminine, and I look old!
[Kojiroh] That's true, but...
[Yayoi] You insensitive fascist!
[Kojiroh] I'm only agreeing with what you just\said!
[Yayoi] You slept with another woman right after\you had me!
[Kojiroh] No... That was for Purin.
[Yayoi] Oh, I see. And you slept with me for\gelatin?
[Kojiroh] What the hell are you talking about?
[Yayoi] I have to get back to work. I don't have\time to take your immature abuse.
[Kojiroh] Oh, come oh...
kYayoi gives me a LONG stare...
[Kojiroh] (She's pissed...)
[Yayoi] Get the hell out of my sight!
[Kojiroh] Fine... I'm just giving your room key\back.
[Yayoi] What...?
[Kojiroh] You gave it to me yesterday. Remember?
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] See?
[Yayoi] I don't need it!

[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Of course you need it. It's yours.
[Kojiroh] You're acting pretty bizarre.

[Kojiroh] Let's stop... It's starting to sound like\a sarcasm.
[Kojiroh] The employees must've left for the day.
[Kojiroh] It's as if that desk and chair aren't\even being used anymore.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I wonder if they'll lend me a desk...
[Yayoi] Never!
[Kojiroh] She heard me...
[Kojiroh] For once, this detective office is\silent.
[Kojiroh] Well, at least Yayoi doesn't seem to be\giving up.
[Kojiroh] The desks are so neat and orderly.
[Kojiroh] So... The staff went home, I guess, and\that's why there isn't a mess here.

[Kojiroh] It makes me wanna cry.
[Kojiroh] It's spotless all around the copier.

[Kojiroh] Maybe that guy complaining about having\to make copies actually left already.

[Kojiroh] Yeah, there's no reason to hang around\here.

[Kojiroh] Maybe all the employees left for the day.
[Kojiroh] It looks like all those desks aren't even\being used anymore.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I wonder if there's one available for me.

[Kojiroh] Yeah, I know. Thanks for reconfirming\that.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] But...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] ...But thank you for today...
[Kojiroh] What? I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
[Yayoi] No, it's nothing... I have to get home\quick, before I throw up everywhere.
[Kojiroh] Fine. Good riddance.
[Yayoi] Thanks for the sympathy.
[Kojiroh] I guess we're in the same boat now, huh?
[Yayoi] Yeah... On the same boat.
[Kojiroh] What the hell are you laughing about?\Crazy woman...
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] I just remembered... Your birthday, about\half a year ago...
[Kojiroh] Listen, just go to sleep. You need some\rest.
[Yayoi] I wanted so much to celebrate your\birthday, just the two of us... I wanted to rock\your world that night...
[Kojiroh] Yeah?
[Yayoi] But you went with some lady to go\drinking... And I had to spend the night alone with\your present, in masturbatory solitude.
[Kojiroh] You're not still bitter about that, are\you?
[Yayoi] Of course I am!!
[Kojiroh] Oh, well... I should've known.
[Yayoi] Uh-ohhh...
[Kojiroh] Hey, are you sure you're alright?
[Yayoi] No, I'm not.
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] (This is bloody ridiculous!)
[Yayoi] Oh, and another thing...
[Kojiroh] Now what.
[Yayoi] I remembered something else I hated.
[Kojiroh] With utter disgust?
[Yayoi] Yes, something I hated with utter disgust.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, I'm like Mr. Justice, you know?
[Yayoi] Shut up, you sarcastic ass.
[Kojiroh] Whoa.
[Yayoi] It was a year ago... On my birthday.
[Kojiroh] Birthdays just don't mix with you, do\they.
[Yayoi] I even had a delicious cake prepared... You\said you were busy with work, and never came home.
[Kojiroh] I don't remember that.
[Yayoi] You were with my father then...
[Kojiroh] Oh.
[Yayoi] Oh, okay. Now I remember.
[Kojiroh] Just give it a rest, will you?
[Yayoi] You even used the company's funds for your\romp at the local whorehouse.
[Kojiroh] Oh my! You knew!
[Yayoi] I remember everything... I baked the cake\and ate it too.
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah! I remember seeing the plate in\the sink when I told you to do the dishes.
[Yayoi] First you made me walk through the cold\night to get dishwashing soap.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, and you forgot the beer I asked you\to pick up.
[Yayoi] All you did was lick off the cake off the\walls and said, "Delicious!" You idiotic bastard!
[Kojiroh] I couldn't help it... I was busy on the\case, I even told you I might not come home that\night.
[Yayoi] What the hell were you investigating at\that whorehouse!!!!
[Kojiroh] Heyyyy!!!!!!
[Yayoi] I feel so... Yuch...
[Kojiroh] Oh, there she goes.
[Yayoi] I sick... Uh-oh...
[Kojiroh] Oh, god... Now my jacket smells awfully\wonderful.
[Yayoi] What's so funny? Does this make you happy?
[Kojiroh] Oh, shut up.
[Yayoi] You're younger than me, but you're taking\care of me...
[Kojiroh] Only by a couple years.
[Yayoi] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] And I liked this shirt so much...
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] It's made of delicate material, you know?\It requires great care to wash.
[Yayoi] ...Let's go.
[Kojiroh] Say what...?
[Yayoi] Let's go to my place. I'll wash it real\good...
[Kojiroh] You'll wash it? Real good?
[Yayoi] Are you deaf?
[Kojiroh] No, I was just surprised to hear you say\that.
[Yayoi] I can give you an even bigger surprise...
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah?
[Yayoi] You'll have to wait and see...
[Kojiroh] You know, I could've sworn you hated me.
[Yayoi] Well, I do hate you.
[Kojiroh] I knew it.
[Yayoi] You're always evading a conversation with\me.
[Kojiroh] Come on, let's talk about something else.
[Yayoi] There you go again.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] Come on, Yayoi.
[Yayoi] What.
[Kojiroh] You've been working yourself too hard.
[Yayoi] I don't care anymore what you say, this is\my life.
[Kojiroh] The employees will call you a\workaholic...
[Yayoi] Alcoholic, maybe... But never workaholic.
[Kojiroh] Well, just wait and see.
[Yayoi] Listen, if the success of this office\demands I become a workaholic, then that's what\I'll be.
[Kojiroh] Don't you think you deserve a break from\all this?
[Yayoi] You still haven't changed, Kojiroh. Still\the same lazy bastard...
[Kojiroh] Are you okay?
[Yayoi] No, I'm not.
[Kojiroh] You drank too much. You're gonna end up\with a big fat belly someday. And you'll probably\puke in a little bit.
[Yayoi] A minute ago you told me to throw up if I\wanted to.
[Kojiroh] Forget what I said.
[Yayoi] You don't want me to throw up?
[Kojiroh] I'd prefer you didn't, yes.
[Yayoi] Okay.
[Kojiroh] Huh?
[Yayoi] I'll do the opposite of everything you\say... Blech!
[Kojiroh] You're acting like a baby... Hey,\Dammit!! Hey!!!!
[Yayoi] I feel like shit... I wanna die.
[Kojiroh] Come on, dammit.
[Yayoi] I feel like a pile of...zebra shit.
[Kojiroh] (Yayoi is in bad shape...)
[Yayoi] Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] What.
[Yayoi] What are you going to do...
[Kojiroh] When?
[Yayoi] When?
[Kojiroh] Jesus, woman! You've become a blithering\idiot!
[Yayoi] What? Do I owe you now...?
[Kojiroh] What did you want me to do? Just leave\you out there?
[Yayoi] Yes. I want to sleep.
[Kojiroh] Then sleep over here.
[Yayoi] Don't move around so much... I'll vomit.

[Kojiroh] I can't believe she drank this much...
[Kojiroh] She's got a high tolerance level. She\hasn't passed out in years.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] But maybe she deserves some good old\unconsciousness... She's been so busy lately.
[Kojiroh] I wish I had more muscle, though.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Most of the employees here are cold\bastards. They should try helping Yayoi a bit more.

[Kojiroh] The last time I was there was three\months ago.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I'm doing my best to carry her, but she's\grown heavy.
[Kojiroh] I think she weighs a little over 130...
[Yayoi] That's not true, you bastard!
[Kojiroh] Oops, I didn't know you were awake.

[Kojiroh] Excuse me?
[Yayoi] It hasn't been touched, even seen by a\man...for months.
[Kojiroh] (There are perks that come with being\next to a drunkard.)
[Yayoi] Look at the shape of my body...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Ah, forget it...
[Kojiroh] Hey, come on...
[Yayoi] I'll just run outside in my underwear and\seduce the first old man I see.
[Kojiroh] Stop this nonsense.
[Yayoi] I'll see how much money I can get out of\him, and then I'll be able to pay my employees'\retirement funds.
[Kojiroh] Yayoi...
[Yayoi] Shut up.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] I can't live by old-fashioned morals\anymore. I have more faith in my flesh... I'm\woman.
[Kojiroh] But...
[Yayoi] Be quiet. It's my job to be responsible\enough to pay for their retirement.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, but...
[Yayoi] I said shut up. What do you care what I do.\You're no longer a part of the office.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] What's wrong, huh!?!? Cat got your\tongue?!?
[Kojiroh] May I say something now?
[Yayoi] Go ahead.
[Kojiroh] I was a part of your office. You guys are\my former colleagues.
[Yayoi] Is that so? Fine! Hey former colleague!
[Kojiroh] Y...yes?
[Yayoi] Sit back and listen... I have a mountain of\things to say to you.
[Kojiroh] Uh-oh...

[Yayoi] I can't take it any longer. I just can't.
[Kojiroh] Oh.
[Kojiroh] Now she's talking the blues.
[Kojiroh] She must've had a lot of stress...
[Kojiroh] The client who offered money for her body\is pretty screwed up, but man, Yayoi kicked him in\the balls?
[Kojiroh] And she walked into a yakuza office and\demanded payment?
[Kojiroh] Damn, she must've been desperate.
[Kojiroh] She must be all worked out.
[Yayoi] I don't wanna do it anymore...
[Kojiroh] Yayoi, you'll catch a cold if you sleep\here.
[Yayoi] I can't drink anymore... I don't want\another sip of the stuff.
[Kojiroh] You've had more than enough already...
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] If your co-workers see their boss like\this, they would be disappointed.
[Yayoi] ...They already are.
[Kojiroh] Will you please stop talking like that?\For cryin' out loud...
[Yayoi] The employees have already handed in their\letters of resignation.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] My company has lost all credit, all its\good reputation...
[Kojiroh] It can't be that bad...
[Yayoi] I know what I'm talking about!
[Kojiroh] (I just can't say anything right\tonight...)
[Yayoi] We're on a holiday, a vacation... There are\many ways to say we've closed down...
[Kojiroh] So in other words, they all left.
[Yayoi] I just... I just don't...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] It's only been 6 months since my father\left, and I can't even support this company.
[Kojiroh] Has it already been that long...?
[Yayoi] No!
[Kojiroh] No?
[Yayoi] It's has been only three months and I\couldn't take care of the business.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] If you're a real man, you take it down like\this.
[Kojiroh] Oh, is that so.
[Yayoi] Drink.
[Kojiroh] I can't drink anymore.
[Yayoi] Fine. Go home.
[Kojiroh] Okay, okay! I'll drink it! ...Geez.
[Kojiroh] Are you serious?
[Yayoi] Yeah... Scary huh?
[Kojiroh] I can't believe that idiot would ever try\suicide.
[Yayoi] You're rather indiscreet, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] ...Sorry, but did he really commit\suicide?
[Yayoi] I just saw him. In the morgue...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] He slit his throat... That's how he died.
[Kojiroh] With a knife?
[Yayoi] Yes.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] And that's it. The office is finsihed.
[Kojiroh] A knife...
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Are you listening to me?!?
[Kojiroh] Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm listening.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] What.
[Yayoi] I hate you... I just hate you!!
[Kojiroh] Jesus, woman! I'm listening!
[Yayoi] Why are you always looking at me like I'm a\sideshow?
[Kojiroh] Oh, geez.
[Yayoi] Anyway, that's about it. Nikaido is dead!!
[Kojiroh] That's amazing.
[Yayoi] I actually find it funny, how much misery\I've been dealt at one time.
[Kojiroh] Well, that's the right attitude to have.\Ha ha...
[Yayoi] You don't need to laugh!!
[Kojiroh] Oh, just lighten up.
[Kojiroh] So, what was in the evening edition of\the newspaper?
[Yayoi] Hey, I actually know something before you\do... Pretty good huh?
[Kojiroh] Just tell me.
[Yayoi] Here it is.
Plop.
[Kojiroh] The paper... What's in it?
[Yayoi] Read carefully.
[Kojiroh] Here it is... "Ms. Lewinsky told lawyers\that she liked the stain, for it gave her dress a\nostalgic, presidential odor."
[Yayoi] You idiot! You're reading the wrong\article!
[Kojiroh] Well, which one is it? This one? "The\Japanese yen plummeted again Tuesday, after the\Prime Minister insisted he be called Prime Rib."
[Yayoi] That's not the one!! It's in the middle of\the society page. Right here.
[Kojiroh] No, even lower.
[Yayoi] Hey...
[Kojiroh] Oh... Katsuragi Private Detective Offices\investigator "Susumu Nikaido"... This one?
[Yayoi] Keep reading.
[Kojiroh] ...was found dead this morning in room\410 of the Princess Hotel. His death has been ruled\a suicide... Suicide!!
[Yayoi] I can't believe you didn't hear about it.
[Kojiroh] This must be some sort of joke.
[Yayoi] No, this is no joke.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] I'll tell you after you have a drink.
[Kojiroh] Well, don't take advantage of me...
[Yayoi] Sounds good.
[Kojiroh] So, what was written in the evening\paper?
[Yayoi] I'll tell you after you have a drink.
[Kojiroh] Jesus...
[Yayoi] My business isn't doing as well as it\appears...
[Kojiroh] I see...
[Kojiroh] (I can't just tell her I already knew\it.)
[Yayoi] First dad was arrested, and then you\left...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Our case success rate went down, and soon\we were getting hardly any cases at all... Things\are getting worse.
[Kojiroh] So it seems.
[Yayoi] I worked as hard as I could. I haven't\slept enough, eaten enough, and ironically, I'm not\even working enough.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] I'd like to recover even an ounce of trust\back in my clients.
[Kojiroh] You haven't been rewarded nearly enough\for your effort.
[Yayoi] The corporate world surrounding detective\agencies doesn't wait around for second chances.\I'm in danger.
[Kojiroh] You're right... There are other superior\offices around.
[Yayoi] You mean your own, don't you!
[Kojiroh] Mine?
[Yayoi] The only other major office is yours!
[Kojiroh] Well, I can't help it. (This is about\that painting...)
[Yayoi] And another thing!
[Kojiroh] There's more?
[Yayoi] The second one in charge, Nikaido...
[Kojiroh] He's on the wanted list...
[Yayoi] What...?
[Kojiroh] They've found him?
[Yayoi] Are you joking? You didn't read the evening\paper?
[Kojiroh] ...?
[Yayoi] This is hilarious. There is actually\something the almighty "Amagi Private Detective\Office" doesn't know.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Ha ha ha...
[Kojiroh] What's so funny!
[Yayoi] You just glide on through life, taking\things as they come.
[Kojiroh] Are you talking about me?
[Yayoi] Yes, and you're prospering at your job.
[Kojiroh] What do you expect from a professional?
[Yayoi] That's the right attitude.
She drinks down the bottle.
And slams the the bottle down.
[Kojiroh] Damn, you're gone, aren't you?
[Yayoi] I'm getting tired of this...
[Kojiroh] You'd better go home and get some rest.
[Yayoi] That's not what I meant.
[Kojiroh] ...Say what?
[Yayoi] I'm tired of being an investigator.
[Kojiroh] What's gotten into you today, Yayoi? Are\you okay?
[Yayoi] Don't you see?
[Kojiroh] What!
[Yayoi] Do you know how hard I tried to gain the\confidence of our clients back?
[Kojiroh] Well, yeah...
[Yayoi] No you don't! The previous boss is a\convict and it's the current boss' father!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] This is like Shakespear!
[Kojiroh] Yeah...
[Yayoi] No it's not!
[Kojiroh] (She never was a good drinker...)
[Yayoi] Drink, or get the hell out!
[Kojiroh] Listen, toots...
[Kojiroh] You shouldn't drink so much of this\stuff, Hey!
[Yayoi] Now... Take a swig!
[Kojiroh] Huh? I have to...
[Yayoi] I can't tolerate a man with no tolerance\for alcohol!
[Kojiroh] Now you're talking crazy, woman.
[Kojiroh] What's gotten into you all of a sudden!
[Yayoi] All of a sudden? I plan to drink long and\slow...
[Kojiroh] That's not what I meant.
[Yayoi] I'd like to know what's gotten into you,\Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] Me?
[Yayoi] Why are you just sitting there like a tame\little bitch!
[Kojiroh] Um, I believe you told me to sit here.
[Yayoi] You just think I'm drunk, and you're trying\to make fun of me!
[Kojiroh] Not at all.
[Yayoi] Here, give me that bottle.
[Kojiroh] Is this any example to set for your\employees? Do you act like this during business\hours??
[Yayoi] What do you care! You're no longer\concerned with this office.
[Kojiroh] Well, I do have a friendship with this\place from long ago.
[Yayoi] Listen, there's nothing you need to worry\about.
[Kojiroh] What the hell do you mean by that!
[Yayoi] Take a look! There aren't any employees\around, so you can forget about your so called\friendship.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] You're late.
[Kojiroh] What?
[Yayoi] Good. Now have a seat.
[Kojiroh] Okay.
I sit down.
[Kojiroh] What's up?
[Yayoi] Heh, heh...
Yayoi drinks from the bottle.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Oh, that's good.
[Kojiroh] Hey, aren't you still working...?
[Yayoi] I'm the boss here... I can do as I please.
[Kojiroh] That's true, but... Uh...
[Yayoi] Oh, shut up. I'm a grown woman now.
[Kojiroh] (Yeah, right.)
[Kojiroh] Are you sure you're not drunk?
[Yayoi] I'm not drunk. I'm just drinking.
[Kojiroh] ...
　Booze
　Tits
[Kojiroh] I'll feel her up once she wakes up.
[Kojiroh] It's against my policy to touch a\sleeping drunk woman.
[Kojiroh] I touch them when they're fully awake.\That's my policy.
[Kojiroh] (Nah, I don't wanna die yet...)
I cop a feel.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] Excuse me.
[Kojiroh] (Shit... She's really pissed.)
[Kojiroh] (You want me to suck her nipples?)
[Kojiroh] (Oh well...)
I try to suck on her nipples.
[Kojiroh] How about this...
[Yayoi] ...Huh?
[Kojiroh] I didn't do it. It wasn't me...
[Kojiroh] (I think she's pissed.)
[Kojiroh] You drank enough.
[Yayoi] I'm not drunk, you know.
[Kojiroh] I never said you were.
Yayoi takes a swig.
[Kojiroh] Hey, if you drink any more, you'll...
[Yayoi] Good stuff, man!
[Kojiroh] (Damn she's starting to smell.)
[Kojiroh] Shit, I haven't been drinking lately.
[Kojiroh] I'm starting to get drunk too.
[Yayoi] I'm so useless...
[Kojiroh] Oh, oh... She's getting blue.
[Yayoi] Don't worry, there's more!
[Kojiroh] More?
[Yayoi] Hell yeah, I brought them from home...\They're my dad's.
[Kojiroh] Oh, in that case.
I take a sip.
[Kojiroh] Holy shit!
[Yayoi] Stop breathing fire.
[Kojiroh] What the hell!?! Hey, my eyes are\spinning!
[Yayoi] Cool... 80 percent alcohol!
[Kojiroh] 80 percent! Are you nuts!?
[Yayoi] Wimp.
[Kojiroh] What?
[Yayoi] ...
[Yayoi] See?
Yayoi drinks down the bottle.
[Kojiroh] Your eyes is spinning...
[Yayoi] What a wimp.
[Kojiroh] (What the hell...)
[Kojiroh] Fine, but just a little.
I take a sip.
[Kojiroh] Yuch! I never knew you drank stuff this\strong!
[Yayoi] Wimp...
[Kojiroh] What?
[Yayoi] It's just scotch whiskey. You're no man if\you can't even handle this.
[Kojiroh] Now you listen to me, you little\donkey-breast!
[Yayoi] This is mine...
[Kojiroh] I don't need it.
 Yayoi takes a few more swigs.
[Kojiroh] Hey, hold your horses with that stuff!
She puts the bottle down.
[Yayoi] Yeah, the good stuff in life.
[Kojiroh] How old are you, again?
[Yayoi] Come on, Kojiroh! Have a glass!
[Kojiroh] No thanks...
[Yayoi] You pussy. You can't even drink!
She burps.
[Kojiroh] Hey! That's enough!
[Kojiroh] (What the hell has gotten into her!)
　Surroundings
　Yayoi
　Booze
　Thighs
[Kojiroh] Yayoi's drunk and asleep.
[Kojiroh] I'd better move her somewhere.
[Yayoi] This is my office! Stop looking around!
[Yayoi] What are you looking at!
[Kojiroh] I find this place interesting. It's fun\looking around.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] This is a bad scene, man...
[Kojiroh] Documents scattered everywhere, beer and\whiskey bottles all over... It's even worse than my\place!
[Yayoi] So what?
[Kojiroh] You're sleeping through your drunkenness.
[Yayoi] I'm not sleeping... I'm just resting.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Take a good look! You've been dying to see\me like this!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (She's lost it tonight.)
[Kojiroh] (I've never seen her this bad since I\cheated on her.)
[Yayoi] You came here just to see me down and out,\didn't you!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Her face red, and she stinks of\alcohol...)
[Yayoi] What are you looking at, monkey-ass!
[Kojiroh] Monkey...ass?
[Kojiroh] Okay. If I'm a monkey's ass, you're a\zebra-colon.
[Yayoi] I can't drink anymore...
[Yayoi] I'm not giving you any.
[Kojiroh] I don't need any.
[Yayoi] It's not a urine bottle, it's a whiskey\bottle.
[Kojiroh] I can see that. Thanks.
[Kojiroh] What the hell's in that bottle.
[Yayoi] There's no urine bottle here...
[Kojiroh] What the HELL are you talking about!
[Kojiroh] Even if I look at her thighs, this\position doesn't excite me.
[Kojiroh] Anyway, I can't just leave her like this.
[Yayoi] What are you staring at, pervert!
[Kojiroh] (This bitch is always angry.)
[Yayoi] You look like an old cuckold who hasn't\been laid in a while.
[Kojiroh] Every man looks like that.
[Yayoi] What are you looking at...
[Kojiroh] The blue sky.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] Sorry.
[Kojiroh] (Scary...)
yOn Yayoi's lap
[Kojiroh] I can't sit on her lap, you idiot.
[Kojiroh] She's sprawled out, totally smashed.
[Kojiroh] (I shouldn't mess around right now...)
eYayoi gives me the stare.
[Kojiroh] Oops, sorry.
[Kojiroh] Upsie-daisy...
Ouch!0
\ 
[Yayoi] Don't you remember? I hate jokes like that?
[Kojiroh] Okay, now I remember.
　Look/Investigate
　Move
　Speak
　Talk to myself
[Kojiroh] Why not go check on how Yayoi is doing?
[Kojiroh] I think Yayoi's in the other room, over\there...
[Kojiroh] Yayoi, hello!!!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Be polite when you yell for me!
[Kojiroh] Oh, she's here.
[Yayoi] Go home! Get out!
[Kojiroh] (Is she in that room over there?)
[Kojiroh] Hey!!!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I guess no one's here.
　Surroundings
　Desk
　Air-conditioner
　Copier
[Kojiroh] No one's in sight...
[Kojiroh] I think Yayoi's in the other room, over\there.
[Kojiroh] No one's here.
[Kojiroh] What's going on here?
[Kojiroh] Is she in the bathroom?
I open the door.
[Kojiroh] ...

004b
[Kojiroh] Nope. This place is empty, too.
[Kojiroh] And that's good. She'd have killed me if\I saw her taking a crap.
[Kojiroh] Yayoi's always here... It's strange to\find this place empty.
[Kojiroh] She said something about the bank a\little while ago, but...
[Kojiroh] Shouldn't there at least be one person\around?
[Kojiroh] It's as if everyone's vanished.
[Kojiroh] The desk is cleaner than I've ever seen\it.
[Kojiroh] This whole place is cleaner than usual.
[Kojiroh] Did your employees suddenly start picking\up after themselves?
[Kojiroh] If Yayoi was over there, she'd have at\least turned on the air-conditioner.
[Kojiroh] The air-conditioner is off... There's no\reason to use it, though.
[Kojiroh] The air-conditioner is off.
[Kojiroh] Well, no one's here. They're just saving\energy...
[Kojiroh] But why isn't anyone here...?
[Kojiroh] And the area around the copier is\clean...
[Kojiroh] And the copier is turned off.
[Kojiroh] What happened to that guy who always\complained about making copies?
　Go outside
　Other room
[Kojiroh] Yeah, let's go to that room over there.
[Kojiroh] I hear a voice from the other side of the\wall.
Knock, knock.
[Yayoi] Who is it.
[Kojiroh] It's me.
[Yayoi] I don't know anyone with that name.
[Kojiroh] Dammit! It's me, as in, Kojiroh.
[Yayoi] Kojiroh? Good. I've been waiting for you.\Come in...
[Kojiroh] (This is a first...)
I open the door.

[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Long time no see... Well, since this\morning, at least.
[Kojiroh] Let's go to the room over there.
[Kojiroh] I'm interested in Yayoi...
[Kojiroh] Wait a minute... Aren't you interested in\how Yayoi is?
[Kojiroh] Let's go to the room over there.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, Yayoi's not here anyway.
[Kojiroh] But this office is never secure... Jesus.
