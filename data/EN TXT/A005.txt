[Kyoko] ...What's wrong?
[Kojiroh] Nothing!
[Kyoko] Don't make such a stern face. You'll never\pick up ladies like that.
[Kojiroh] Re...Really?
[Kyoko] Did something happen?
[Kojiroh] No, but I'm a little bothered by\something...
[Kyoko] Tell me about it. We're partners, right?
[Kojiroh] All right, but not here. Later.
[Kyoko] Okay. What about the bug?
[Kojiroh] Oh, I planted it perfectly. But it's only\got a range of 100 feet.
[Kyoko] What should we do then?
[Kojiroh] I'll have to listen right here...
[Kyoko] Right in front of the embassy?
[Kojiroh] We have no choice. You keep an eye out\for trouble.
I dig through my pockets.
[Kojiroh] I'll just put this earphone in my ear\and...

All I hear is static.
[Kojiroh] (Sounds like shit. Is something\interfering with the line?)
[Kojiroh] (I should have known... Another waste of\good, hard work...)
[Kyoko] How is it?
[Kojiroh] Shhh!
[Woman's voice] ...That's what I think, at least.
[Kojiroh] (A woman's voice... Marina?...)
[Man's voice] I see.
[Kojiroh] (This must be Mido...)
[Woman's voice] Since we don't know what his\intentions are, I think we should beef up security\around the embassy.
[Man's voice] I'm sure he's just a journalist. I've\met a lot of characters like him in my day.
[Woman's voice] Nevertheless...
[Man's voice] Today I have to go to the opera with\the guest of honor. It's my job.
[Woman's voice] Then let's take extra special\precautions.
[Man's voice] You worry too much. I'll be fine.\Nobody wants to get into this embassy anyway.
[Woman's voice] Then let me...
[Man's voice] I thought I told you not to worry.
[Woman's voice] ...
[Man's voice] As Ambassador I order you to go home,\Ms. Hojo.
[Woman's voice] ...Yes, sir.
A door slams.
[Kojiroh] Wow...
[Kyoko] What's going on?
[Kojiroh] What's that?
[Kyoko] I asked you what's going on. Did something\happen?
[Kojiroh] Now don't jump to conclusions.
[Kyoko] Nothing happened?
[Kojiroh] No.
[Kyoko] No, nothing happened, or no, something\happened? Which one?!
[Kojiroh] Kyoko, how fast can you run?
[Kyoko] What?
[Kojiroh] I asked how fast!
[Kyoko] What do you want to know that for?
[Kojiroh] I'll race you to my office. Then we'll\talk.
[Kyoko] Wait a minute!... Hey!
A siren sounds.
[Policeman's voice] Hey! What are you two doing\there?!
[Kojiroh] Let's get out of here.
[Kyoko] Alright. Let's split up and meet at the\office.
[Kojiroh] Good thinking.
[Kyoko] You'd better tell me what's going on when\we get there!

[Kyoko] Where were you? I went all the way to your\office.
[Kojiroh] Why are you all dressed up? Trying to\seduce the cops?
[Kyoko] Right now school is closed... I'd think the\cops would be more suspicious of me dressed in\school uniform.
[Kojiroh] Maybe you're right... Why are you acting\so nervous?
[Kyoko] Because I am nervous!
[Kojiroh] Is your period late or something?
[Kyoko] Come on! I don't have to worry about\that... I mean... That's not why!
[Kojiroh] Then what's wrong?
[Kyoko] Marina's inside the embassy.
[Kojiroh] Marina...?
[Kyoko] Typical me, like an idiot I just bumped\into her.
[Kojiroh] Marina's in the embassy...?
[Kyoko] I wonder what she's doing here.
[Kojiroh] That's what I want to know.
[Kyoko] We can't do anything about it today.
[Kojiroh] Why not?
[Kyoko] Why do you think? We look pretty suspicious\out here.
[Kojiroh] Grow up!
[Kyoko] You sound like my mom!
[Kojiroh] Marina has come into the picture. Things\are taking a turn for the better.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] Marina's in the embassy, right?
[Kyoko] Yeah...
[Kojiroh] She's got a nose like a police dog.\Really knows her shit.
[Kyoko] That's why we should get out of here.
[Kojiroh] Wrong. That's why we can get inside. So\she can see what I'm up to.
[Kyoko] Oh.
[Kojiroh] I may be able to meet Ambassador Mido.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] What's wrong with you?
[Kyoko] Nothing.
[Kojiroh] Don't worry. Look at this.

[Kojiroh] Do you know what this is?

[Kojiroh] Do you know?
[Kyoko] It's a surveillance bug, right? What are\you going to do with it?
[Kojiroh] What do you mean, what am I gonna do with\it? It's sort of obvious...
[Kyoko] Don't tell me you're going to plant it in\the embassy! You must be nuts?!
[Kojiroh] Must be.
[Kyoko] That's a felony.
[Kojiroh] Not if I don't get caught.

[Kojiroh] And look who's talking! I don't know any\school girls who hang out around this place.
[Kyoko] When you're dressed in a uniform the police\are a lot nicer to you.
[Kojiroh] Because you're both public servants?
[Kyoko] It has nothing to do with work.

[Kyoko] How do I look?
[Kojiroh] Pretty damn good.
[Kyoko] Actually, I don't. But thanks anyway.

[Kyoko] Change your mind?
[Kojiroh] Unfortunately.

[Kyoko] I'm still at the same place.
[Kojiroh] The same...place?
[Kyoko] I wrote it down, remember? Where I live.
[Kojiroh] Now I remember.
[Kyoko] Close to the international school in the\girl's dorm. I'll probably be there today and\tomorrow.
[Kojiroh] What about the day after tomorrow?
[Kyoko] I'll probably already be...

[Kojiroh] Oh, yeah...
[Akane] It has something to do with that phony Kou.

[Kojiroh] What am I going to do in there again?
[Kojiroh] I'll bet I can get away if I go that\way...
[Police] Hey! Stop where you are!
[Kojiroh] I'm getting out of here!

[Security guard] What are you doing? The Ambassador\is waiting inside.
[Kojiroh] Hi there.
[Security guard] You again... What business have\you here anyway?
[Kojiroh] I have an appointment to get a story from\the Ambassador.
[Security guard] The story...?
[Kojiroh] That's right. I'm a journalist.
[Security guard] No one told me about any of this.
[Kojiroh] Why don't you go and confirm it?
[Security guard] Okay. It won't take but a minute.
[Kojiroh] Take your time. Your loyalty is virtuous.
[Security guard] Just wait here...
[Kojiroh] (Stairwell #1 is all clear...)
[Kojiroh] (There's probably a surveillance camera\somewhere...)
[Kojiroh] (Maybe that's it on top of the gate.)
[Kojiroh] Mr. Security guard...
[Security guard] Leave me alone. I'm trying to get\through.
[Kojiroh] I know, but I was wondering if that thing\on top of the gate is a surveillance camera.
[Security guard] That's exactly what it is. Your\face is being checked by the monitor right now.
[Kojiroh] I see. That's good.
[Security guard] ...
[Kojiroh] (Check out my face real good.)
[Kojiroh] (But I wonder if it's really recording\me...)
[Security guard] What? You haven't made any such\appointments?
[Kojiroh] ...?!
[Security guard] I see. Don't worry, I'll get rid\of him...
[Kojiroh] (... Did I mess up?)
[Kojiroh] (That's strange... I thought I could get\in...)
[Security guard] Sorry, Charlie, but the\Ambassador's never heard of you... Huh?
[Kojiroh] He's a busy man...
[Security guard] Yes... Yes... No... I understand.
He hangs up the phone.
[Security guard] Apparently you did have an\appointment after all.
[Kojiroh] Told you so. (That was a close one.)
[Security guard] It's very rare for the Ambassador\to allow reporters inside, but...
[Kojiroh] But you're gonna let me come in now,\aren't you?
[Security guard] Yeah...
[Kojiroh] (Like taking candy from a baby.)
[Security guard] If you give me any more trouble\I'll call the police.
[Security guard] The Ambassador is very busy. He\has no time for you.
[Security guard] So get lost, if you catch my\drift.
[Security guard] What? You're a journalist?
[Security guard] If you're looking for a story you\need to get an appointment first.
[Security guard] Without an appointment the\Ambassador won't see you.
[Security guard] You're asking me if the Ambassador\is here?
[Security guard] Why do you want to know about\that?
[Security guard] Go on. Get lost.

[Kojiroh] This place looks pretty well fortified...
[Kojiroh] If I'm not careful I'll get caught.
[Kojiroh] I shouldn't hang around too much...
[Kojiroh] That cop is staring at me pretty\threateningly...
[Kojiroh] This place is like a fortress...
[Kojiroh] The Eldian Republic's embassy...
[Kojiroh] Supposedly this is where Mido works as\Ambassador.
[Kojiroh] I doubt I could get into this place\without a tank...
[Kojiroh] This things supposed to be bullet-proof.\It looks thick and heavy.
[Kojiroh] Pretty thick gate... I doubt I can break\through without an armored truck.
[Kojiroh] I don't even want to think about entering\through here...
[Security guard] I deactivated the lock... You can\go in.
[Security guard] You should go quickly for your own\sake.
[Security guard] What are you looking at?
[Security guard] Unless you have some business\here, you should hurry up and disappear.

[Security guard] Hey! You can't just go in there!
[Security guard] I'm getting sick of your face... I\won't let you in here.
[Security guard] Nobody gets in unless they're\affiliated with the embassy.
[Security guard] If you keep standing there I'll\call the police.
[Kojiroh] (I'd be better off together with Kyoko.)
[Security guard] You come here a lot...
[Security guard] If you behave suspiciously I'll\call the police.
[Security guard] Go on. Get out of here.
[Kojiroh] I haven't met Mido yet...
[Kojiroh] I came here to see Mido.
[Kojiroh] Kyoko's waiting for me...
[Kojiroh] This place is no good. It gives me bad\vibes...
[Kojiroh] I'll go back to the international school.

[Security guard] No one gets in who doesn't have\business here.
[Security guard] And you don't have any, so you're\not getting in, okay?

[Kojiroh] In the light, though, it looks pretty\tough to crack.
[Kojiroh] If I went in they'd kill my ass dead.

[Kojiroh] I hate the way that the crime prevention\mechanisms are hidden.
[Kojiroh] No, not crime prevention mechanisms. More\specifically, they're mechanisms to keep my ass\out...
[Kojiroh] I guess an embassy would be a prime\target for terrorism.
[Kojiroh] Just for that they'd have to resort to a\heavy-duty defense system...
