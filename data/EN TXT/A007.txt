[Girl] Things are a little dangerous around here\lately.
[Girl] Well, I'll tell you what's dangerous.
[Girl] Yesterday, someone was murdered in a\neighborhood not too far from here.
[Girl] And there was a gunfight right on Central\Avenue.
[Girl] A gunfight? It was probably a scuffle within\the Mafia.
[Girl] I'm too scared to even walk home at night.
[Businessman] Things are getting insane around\here...
[Businessman] Well, actually...
[Businessman] Yesterday there was a battle here\that looked like a scene out of an action film.
[Businessman] I heard it was a fight between Mafia\rivals, but that's not it.
[Businessman] It was a couple of girls, and some\foreign guys involved in a gunfight. A goddamn\gunfight of all things.
[Businessman] I was sleeping right on that bench,\and it scared the hell out of me.
[Businessman] What? Why was I sleeping on the\bench, you ask?
[Businessman] Well, I was at this whorehouse, you\see, and by the time I was done, I'd missed the\last train.

[Salesclerk] Yes, sir...
[Kojiroh] (Nothing beats good old customer\service.)
[Salesclerk] What can I do for you?
[Kojiroh] I'd like some cute jewelry for a little\girl.
[Salesclerk] What sort of jewelry?
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] (Akane's so... Boyish.)
[Salesclerk] May I help you?
[Kojiroh] I want something feminine to show to a\masculine woman... What do you think would be good?
[Salesclerk] Okay... It'd be better to emphasize\the features from the neck up.
[Kojiroh] From the neck up.
[Salesclerk] Don't waste your time with rings,\ankle bracelets, or other body items.
[Kojiroh] I see...
[Salesclerk] You see, the first thing you notice on\a person is their face.
[Kojiroh] How do you know so much?
[Salesclerk] Well, I'm very insecure and I spent my\entire life worrying about how to look good.
[Kojiroh] I see.
[Salesclerk] Anyway, consider buying lipstick, eye\shadow, hair ribbons... That sort of thing.
[Kojiroh] How about rouge? Give me a really cute\color...
[Salesclerk] Rouge, coming right up!
[Kojiroh] That's the spirit!

[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I'll give this to Akane, and she'll look\like a whore!
[Kojiroh] I hope I'm not wasting my time...
eve_06
[Kojiroh] I'll get my thoughts back together\again...
[Kojiroh] And now, to get a surprise for Akane...
[Kojiroh] What about some hemorrhoid medicine?
[Kojiroh] Yeah, suppositories will do. She'll be\shocked, alright.
eve_16
[Kojiroh] Hey, clerk!
[Salesclerk] How may I help you?
[Kojiroh] ...This stuff better be reasonably\priced.
[Salesclerk] I don't know about others, but this\one is as good as it gets.
[Kojiroh] Stop speaking in movie titles.
[Salesclerk] Okay, consider my habit gone with the\wind. What can I do for you?
[Kojiroh] Give me some suppositories. The biggest,\fattest ones you have.
[Salesclerk] The biggest, fattest ones we have?
[Kojiroh] Yeah. Ones that'll rip the anus to shreds\upon entrance.
[Salesclerk] I don't think such medicinal\suppositories exist...
[Kojiroh] Well just check if you have them!!
[Salesclerk] Okay, okay!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Salesclerk] We do carry some very large\suppositories, but this is it.
[Kojiroh] This? My little finger is bigger than\this!
[Salesclerk] Perhaps you should do the right thing\and try the S&M shop down the street.
[Kojiroh] Shit.
[Salesclerk] What do you need them for?
[Kojiroh] Are you a complete idiot?? I need them to\stick in my ass!
[Salesclerk] Oh, I see.
[Kojiroh] Sorry to take your time. Jeez...

[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Well, they don't sell gigantic\suppositories...
eve_06
[Kojiroh] Is there anything I want to buy? Oh\yeah!!!
[Kojiroh] It's Akane's birthday!!! I'll have to get\her something...
[Kojiroh] I'll buy her some chopsticks. Better yet,\I'll only get her one.
[Kojiroh] Okay, where can I buy a chopstick...
eve_16
[Kojiroh] Clerk!
[Salesclerk] Yes, sir?
[Kojiroh] I have a strange request.
[Salesclerk] What might that be?
[Kojiroh] Give me one chopstick.
[Salesclerk] Just one?
[Kojiroh] Yeah. And it's a birthday present, so put\a nice ribbon on it.
[Salesclerk] I'm sorry, we only sell them in\packages.
[Kojiroh] You don't sell just one?!
[Salesclerk] I have a fork...
[Kojiroh] No, no... It has to be a chopstick.\Later.
[Salesclerk] Please come again.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Okay, so that idea went down the drain.
