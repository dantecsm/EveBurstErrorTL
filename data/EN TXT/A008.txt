[Kojiroh] A piece of ass like Marina would show up\with a slick papa in a fancy hotel like this.

[Kojiroh] I'll tell you what I think.
[Akane] Huh?
[Kojiroh] First of all, you're in this hotel.
[Akane] Gulp...
[Kojiroh] You knock on the door. The door opens and\you talk to Mr. A in the hallway...
[Akane] What are you saying?...
[Kojiroh] Maybe it's because you're late... I don't\know. But Mr. A gets madder and madder and SMACK!!
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] Sound pretty close?
[Akane] Not at all... And quit acting like you saw\what happened!

[Kojiroh] That girl?
[Akane] You know, the one you took a shower with...
[Kojiroh] Whoa! Do me a favor and keep that big\mouth shut in front of Yayoi, alright?
[Akane] I'm not that dumb! It's a misunderstanding\anyway, right?
[Kojiroh] What? You don't believe me?
[Akane] Well, you're not all that trustworthy.
[Kojiroh] Gimme a break, girl!
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] Purin asked me to apologize to you.
[Akane] For what?
[Kojiroh] You know, for slapping you around. She\says you crossed her pilgrimage to Mecca.
[Akane] Mecca?
[Kojiroh] She's Muslim, you know.
[Akane] Really...
[Kojiroh] (Akane seems strange...)
[Akane] Hey, Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] What do you want now?
[Akane] Do you want my camera?
[Kojiroh] What? What's gotten into you anyway?
[Akane] I don't know. I just sort of think you\should have it.
[Kojiroh] I thought you valued it more than life\itself.
[Akane] Yeah, you're right... Ha-ha-ha... What was\I thinking?
[Kojiroh] Lately a lot of people are acting\strange... Like that butthead Nikaido.
[Akane] Did he do something strange?
[Kojiroh] Well, you know, that pecker's strange to\begin with.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] What's it to you anyway?

[Nikaido] It's me, you idiot! Here, get a good look\at my handsome visage.
[Kojiroh] Don't make me puke, Nikaido.
[Nikaido] You can see me though right?
[Kojiroh] I was ignoring you, duh.
[Nikaido] Heh-heh-heh. You know, I came across an\incredible clue.
[Kojiroh] I'm not listening...
[Nikaido] Don't you want to know what it is?
[Kojiroh] Nope. Not at all.
[Nikaido] Come on. It's a vital clue.
[Kojiroh] I couldn't care less. You can leave now.
[Nikaido] Hey! You don't wanna know? I have a very\important piece of information!
[Kojiroh] If I said I wanted to hear it, would you\even tell me?
[Nikaido] You stupid idiot. What kind of fool would\give out information to a rival detective?
[Kojiroh] That's exactly why I told you I don't\give a flying hoot.
[Nikaido] Let me see that you want to... Just a\little bit.
[Kojiroh] What's with you, anyway?
[Nikaido] It's a big mistake to keep concentrating\on Kou's house.
[Kojiroh] Is this guy talking to himself?
[Nikaido] I'm looking at this investigation from a\more global perspective.
[Kojiroh] You mean like the other people mixed up\in this?
[Nikaido] What?
[Kojiroh] Like Mr. M?
[Nikaido] How do you know about him!?
[Kojiroh] (I read it in your appointment book,\fool.)
[Nikaido] Don't you dare steal my leads!

【小次郎】『へいベイベー、ジュテーム、ウォアイニィ、アイラヴユゥ！』

【小次郎】正確には「ベイビー」が正しいんだぞ。
[Kojiroh] The fliers have some new information.\Let's see...
[Kojiroh] 'Gangsters and detectives are asked to\please leave the premises.'
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] How dare they put detectives in the same\class as gangsters.
[Kojiroh] This one says... "My friend, ever think\about working as a hotel receptionist and rule the\world?"
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I seriously doubt that.
[Kojiroh] No matter how many times you look at it\you can't take it home.
[Kojiroh] That's one big damn window... Can't take\it home, though.
　Go outside

[Kojiroh] Akane seemed strange... I'd better see\what she's up to.
[Kojiroh] She seemed like she was really nervous...
[Kojiroh] I'll go after Akane!

[Kojiroh] (She's tougher than I thought...)
[Kojiroh] (It's like she's trying to shake a\tail...)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (She's walking in the hallway... Checking\the room numbers.)
[Kojiroh] (Which means she's meeting someone... A\secret rendezvous?)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (She stopped!... Room 410.)
Knock! Knock!
[Akane] It's me...
[Kojiroh] (She sounds so timid... That's not like\her...)
[Kojiroh] (Could she be meeting with the\President?)
The door opens.
...
[Akane] I know... But...
[Kojiroh] (She's whispering... I can't really make\it out.)
[Akane] Please forgive me... I bumped into someone\I know down in the lobby and...
Smack!
[Akane] Ouch!

[Kojiroh] ...!?
[Akane] I'm sorry... Please, please forgive me...
[Kojiroh] (Son of a bitch! He hit her!)
[Kojiroh] (But I can't help her now...)
[Akane] I'm so sorry... You're right... It's my own\fault...
[Kojiroh] (What is going on?)
[Akane] ...Forgive me. May I come in?
...
The door closes.
[Kojiroh] (They closed the door.)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] ...I'd better get back to the lobby.

[Kojiroh] It's none of my business who Akane meets\with or what scoop she gets anyway...

[Kojiroh] Hold on!...
[Kojiroh] Akane was acting strange...
[Kojiroh] Should I go outside?...
a007
[Kojiroh] It's probably a good idea. I feel like\getting out of here.
[Kojiroh] I'll go check out the cocktail lounge.

[Kojiroh] There's a waitress there right now...
[Kojiroh] I guess I have no choice...

[Kojiroh] Glen should be waiting for me.
[Kojiroh] Look out, cocktail lounge! Here I come!

[Kojiroh] It's not cool to make Glen wait...

[Kojiroh] Cocktail lounge... You gotta love it.

[Nikaido] But it's a minor setback on the way to a\greater victory. You should enjoy your two minutes\of glory, pecker-breath.
[Kojiroh] Are you sure you're all right? You're not\losing your mind from shock or anything, are you?
[Nikaido] And my boss will congratulate me for not\being poopy like you.

[Kojiroh] Tough break, pal.

[Kojiroh] I'll keep my eyes peeled. (I can't stand\this idiot.)
[Nikaido] What's with that 'I can't stand this\idiot' look on your face?
[Kojiroh] It's just that I really can't stand you,\idiot.
[Nikaido] This case isn't just about a missing\painting.
[Kojiroh] What's it about then?
[Nikaido] I'm not telling you any more...

[Kojiroh] Another case?
[Nikaido] You don't have any idea what's going on,\do you? There's a whole other side to all this.\You're a damn fool if you don't see it.
[Kojiroh] Another side...
[Nikaido] Kojiroh, you did a good job. If only you\were smart like me you could see what's going on.
[Kojiroh] You're just a sore loser. Figures.
[Nikaido] Go ahead and think that.

[Kojiroh] We meet a lot, Nikaido.

[Nikaido] Yes, you solved a part of it.
[Kojiroh] Huh?
[Nikaido] Huh, a worthless like you wouldn't know,\but I'll let you in on something. Hidden within\that painting is a deadly secret.

[Kojiroh] Scent of soap... It's nice.

[Akane] You're the only person who does that kind\of thing.
[Kojiroh] You'll have a good time with that camera,\Akane. Bringing to life the wildest fantasies of\whatever hot-shot you're rolling with tonight.

[Akane] Stop looking at it. You'll wreck it!

　Look/Investigate
　Move
　Speak
　Front desk
[Front desk] To get to the cocktail lounge, just go\down the escalator on your right, please.
[Front desk] Do you have a reservation?
[Front desk] In addition to economy rooms here, we\also have first and second class rooms and a VIP\suite.
[Front desk] The VIP suites alone have 4-digit room\numbers, the rest are 3 digits.
[Front desk] I see. You're not a registered guest?
[Front desk] In that case, please make like a\tree...
　Surroundings
　Chandelier
　Fliers
　Window
[Kojiroh] When I look around, I feel like I want to\break things. I'd better not look.
[Kojiroh] This is the biggest hotel in town... I\shouldn't be surprised that the lobby is so nice.
[Kojiroh] Whenever I'm surrounded by so much\beautiful stuff, I start to feel like I want to\break it!
[Front desk] Please refrain from breaking things,\sir.
[Kojiroh] ...What can I do to rile this guy up?
[Kojiroh] It's a big chandelier all the same.
[Kojiroh] It's a shame I can't take it home with me\the way I always do the towels and shower caps.
[Kojiroh] If I hung that chandelier in my office,\there'd be no space left to live in.
[Kojiroh] Oh, quit sounding so pathetic.
[Kojiroh] I already read the fliers...
[Kojiroh] Look at the fliers again?
[Kojiroh] What have we here... 'Thank you for going\through the trouble to look here.'
[Kojiroh] 'As a reward for your troubles, you will\now learn the secret password that will transfer\you to the last disc'.
[Kojiroh] 'Of course there's no such thing, so\you're out of luck. Please enjoy the rest of the\game.'
[Kojiroh] ...What on God's earth does this shit\mean?
[Kojiroh] I love looking at these fliers...
[Kojiroh] Alright, I'll check 'em out. What do we\have here...
[Kojiroh] 'Not there! Uh, Ah, That's my\belly-button...'
[Kojiroh] Good old freedom of speech.
[Kojiroh] That's what it actually says.
[Kojiroh] Look again?
[Kojiroh] 'Please don't look anymore... Stop\punishing me.'
[Kojiroh] What the hell is that supposed to mean?
[Kojiroh] Fliers... Let's see what they say.
【小次郎】『喉の奥深くまで挿入され、順子は吐き気をもよおした。』
【小次郎】『しかし頭を固定されているので、肉棒を口腔から吐き出すこともできない。』
【小次郎】『口腔を、限界まで硬くなった肉棒が出入りしながら、熱い粘液が喉にあびせかけられる。』
【小次郎】『むせかえりそうになりなが、順子は濃く粘りけのある精液を、黙って嚥下するしかなかった。ごくっ、ごくっ。』
[Kojiroh] This shit's making me impatient.
[Kojiroh] But it was exciting...
[Kojiroh] This is different from what was written\before.
[Kojiroh] 'I'll teach you a special secret for\looking here. If you lock the KANA key the dialogue\in the game will speed along quickly.'
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I have no idea what this means.
[Kojiroh] It looks like the fliers have changed\again...
【小次郎】『いたいたわあ、ソたレ、とぉったてもふたとくたて‥‥モグたモたグしたちゃうっ。たぬきより』
[Kojiroh] ...Sounds familiar.
[Kojiroh] It's changed again... What next?
【小次郎】『へいベイベー、ジュテーム、ウォアイニィ、アイラヴユゥ！』
[Kojiroh] ...
【小次郎】そういえば日本の歌い手さんは、なんで「ベイベー」って発音するんだろうか。
【小次郎】正確には「ベイビー」が正しいんだぞ。
[Kojiroh] The fliers have some new information.\Let's see...
[Kojiroh] 'Gangsters and detectives are asked to\please leave the premises.'
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] How dare they put detectives in the same\class as gangsters.
[Kojiroh] This one says... "My friend, ever think\about working as a hotel receptionist and rule the\world?"
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I seriously doubt that.
[Kojiroh] Looks about 300 feet high...
[Kojiroh] There's no reason for it, but I gotta\hand it to this place. It's a mighty big window.
[Kojiroh] God, that window's big. The lobby's two\stories high, for Christ's sake.
[Kojiroh] The window goes all the way to the\ceiling. Bigger than momma's ass.
　Go outside
　Cocktail lounge
[Kojiroh] Should I go out?
[Kojiroh] I guess so. I'm in the mood for some\fresh air.
a007
[Kojiroh] It's right at the bottom of the\escalator.
[Kojiroh] I'm off to the cocktail lounge.
a009
[Kojiroh] Glen should be waiting there for me.
[Kojiroh] Look out, cocktail lounge, here I come.
