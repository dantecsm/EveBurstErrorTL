[Purin] Over here, Kojiroh!
[Kojiroh] (I guess she's excited.)
[Kojiroh] Hey, you'll fall if you keep going this\fast...
Purin trips.
[Purin] Ouch... I fell over...
[Kojiroh] Just calm down.
[Purin] I'm so happy to finally be able to meet\this person.
[Kojiroh] Good for you.
[Kojiroh] (I wonder what kinda person this is...)
[Kojiroh] (I hear they're to be the next successor\to the throne.)
[Kojiroh] (It could be a prince, or maybe a\princess... Or something else.)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (I should stand up straight and adjust my\collar.)
[Kojiroh] (Nah, I'll just relax and be myself...)
[Purin] This way, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] Gotcha.
Knock, knock.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Purin] ...
[Kojiroh] What is it?
[Purin] That's strange...
Knock, knock.
[Kojiroh] Why don't you use the key?
[Purin] It's much more polite to knock before\entering.
[Kojiroh] Whatever...
[Kojiroh] (Hey...)
[Kojiroh] (How was Purin able to get the key...)
[Purin] Oh, well... Let's go in.
[Kojiroh] Okay.
We open the door...

[Kojiroh] (Whoa...)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Sorry, we didn't mean to disturb you.

Bam, bam!
[Kojiroh] (Shit, I'm screwed. Better hide.)
[Kojiroh] Purin...
[Prisia] Yes?
[Kojiroh] Are your motor skills good?
[Prisia] Well, yes... I was champion of the\breaststroke in high school.
[Kojiroh] Okay, listen to me Purin...
[Prisia] Yes?
[Kojiroh] The next time I shoot, I want you to go\downstairs through that window.
[Prisia] What?! But...
[Kojiroh] Don't worry, there's usually only one guy\that comes through the window. If there was a\second, he would've come in already.
[Prisia] So there's no more, right?
[Kojiroh] Hopefully.
[Prisia] ...
[Kojiroh] If you could, go down about two floors...
[Prisia] But, I... This is crazy...
[Kojiroh] Sometimes survival requires a little\insanity. We're doing it.
[Prisia] What about you though?
[Kojiroh] I'll stay here and try to stop them.
[Prisia] No!
[Kojiroh] Hey, that's our only choice! We'll both\be killed otherwise...
[Prisia] But...
[Kojiroh] If I wanted to hear any buts, I'd put my\head next to your ass.
[Prisia] Kojiroh!
[Kojiroh] Yeah?

[Prisia] Oh, Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Come on, you'd better hurry.
[Prisia] Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] What...?
[Prisia] You're quite an order giver...
[Kojiroh] Uh-oh... This means I've been bossing the\future queen around.
[Prisia] I'll forgive you.

[Kojiroh] ...

[Prisia] You must stay alive...
[Kojiroh] I will. Don't worry.
[Prisia] ...
[Kojiroh] Dying isn't one of my skills. Trust me.
[Prisia] ...
[Kojiroh] If you get away, run over to the\Katsuragi Private Detective Offices.
[Prisia] Katsuragi...?
[Kojiroh] Look for a scary bitch named Yayoi.\She'll be smoking a cigarette.
[Prisia] Is she your woman...?
[Kojiroh] Not quite... But we were close in the\past.
[Prisia] ...
[Kojiroh] She's someone I trust. That's all.
[Prisia] If you trust her, I'll trust her.
[Kojiroh] Good. I'll tell you her address, so pay\attention.
[Prisia] Okay.
[Kojiroh] If you get lost, ask someone in the area.\It's a well-known office.
[Prisia] Okay.
[Kojiroh] But whatever you do, don't mention my\name.
[Prisia] Why not?
[Kojiroh] Could you make it sound like you,\yourself, sought for her help?
[Prisia] ...Okay.

[Voice] But he's got a gun... And he's got a pretty\good aim.
[Voice] He's one man against the three of us.
[Voice] We have the advantage in firepower.
[Voice] Use the machine gun!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] A what?! Shit... I'll be Swiss cheese!
[Kojiroh] Kojiroh Amagi... Dies like Swiss\cheese... Yeah, right!

[Prisia] NO!
[Kojiroh] We can't just stay here...
BAM!BAM!

[Kojiroh] Stop talking crazy, woman... They're\after YOU...

[Kojiroh] Don't try to be brave... You'll get tired\quickly.
[Prisia] But...
[Kojiroh] Just act casual, you know? Hang loose.
[Prisia] How... How irresponsible!
[Kojiroh] Call me what you want... But I think\you'll do much better that way.
[Prisia] But...
HUG...
[Prisia] Whoa...
[Kojiroh] I've seen people just ruined by stress...\I don't want you doing that.

[Prisia] I'm scared... I'm so scared!!
[Kojiroh] It's all right.
[Prisia] The political world isn't a place for\normal people... It's a place for selfish, hateful\old farts.
[Kojiroh] You'll be just fine, Purin.
[Prisia] Why do you say so?
[Kojiroh] I can just tell.
[Prisia] How?
[Kojiroh] I just can.
[Prisia] ...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Prisia] Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Yeah?
[Prisia] Are you sure?
[Kojiroh] About what?
[Prisia] I'll be okay?
[Kojiroh] Definitely.
[Prisia] You think so?
[Kojiroh] I know so.
[Prisia] Do you swear to Allah?
[Kojiroh] I swear to Allah.
[Prisia] Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Yeah?
[Prisia] I have something to tell you.
[Kojiroh] Spit it out, woman!

[Kojiroh] I'll think of something...
[Voice] Here! In the shadow of the sofa!

[Prisia] Now what'll we do?
[Kojiroh] The shooting has stopped... Cover your\ears, Purin.

[Kojiroh] Purin...
[Prisia] Stoleman told me to go to you, if anything\happens.
[Kojiroh] Kou?
[Prisia] Yes. And he was right.
[Kojiroh] (But why?? Kou and I aren't acquainted at\all...)
[Prisia] Kojiroh, you did so much for me... I don't\know how I can repay you.
[Kojiroh] Nah, I just had you do some chores.
[Prisia] And it was so fun when we went to the\pool.
[Kojiroh] I remember it well.
[Prisia] Me too.
[Kojiroh] So you know everything about Purin being\at my office...
[Prisia] I remember it completely.
[Kojiroh] And about cooking meals.
[Prisia] Everything.
[Kojiroh] And the housecleaning and laundry.
[Prisia] Of course.
[Kojiroh] And the time we took a bath together?
[Prisia] ...
[Kojiroh] (She's turning bright red...)
[Prisia] ...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Prisia] I...
[Kojiroh] Yes?
[Prisia] I must partake in the commemoration for\the Eldian Republic...
[Kojiroh] I see...
[Prisia] Stoleman was like a father to me. He was\very kind, but...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Prisia] But now... Stoleman's dead...
[Kojiroh] Purin...
[Kojiroh] (Is she shaking...?)
[Prisia] If I said that I was scared, I'd probably\fail as Queen.
[Kojiroh] Listen, even a queen is human.
[Prisia] But the public won't see me as the same.
[Kojiroh] They think you're special, right?
[Prisia] Yes, and my job is to meet their\expectation.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (This is ridiculous.)
[Prisia] I was supposed to receive something from\Stoleman.
[Kojiroh] I heard.
[Prisia] He was to give me the original plate for a\silkscreen.
[Kojiroh] ...A plate? A silkscreen?
[Prisia] Yes, I was going to get the original\printing plate from him.
[Kojiroh] By any chance, is it in two pieces?
[Prisia] That's the one. It's useless without both\of the pieces.
[Kojiroh] So what's the secret behind that little\piece of artwork?
[Prisia] That little picture happens to be our\National Seal.
[Kojiroh] That thing is your...National Seal?!
[Prisia] Yes, it's the one and only symbol of the\Eldian Republic.
[Kojiroh] So it's like the national stamp or\something, right?
[Prisia] Yes. I need that symbol to take the\throne. It's our national tradition.
[Kojiroh] You can't become royalty without it?
[Prisia] That's correct.
[Kojiroh] What if someone else comes up with it?
[Prisia] That's a situation we'd like to avoid at\all costs.
[Kojiroh] So let me get this straight. If I had\that National Seal, I can be the King?
[Prisia] A little extreme, but yes.
[Kojiroh] The National Seal...
[Prisia] Our country has fought for the National\Seal countless times.
[Kojiroh] Fought...?
[Prisia] Yes... Blood flowed into every river on\the continent.
[Kojiroh] Wow... So that's the curse...
[Prisia] It may be called a curse. Everyone who has\carried that seal has met death...
[Kojiroh] So that's why...
[Prisia] Lachal served the royalty for years, but\after creating the National Seal, he took his own\life.
[Kojiroh] I get it... He couldn't live with himself\anymore...
[Kojiroh] (So that fat bastard was trying to get\the National Seal...)
[Kojiroh] (What the hell was he up to...)
[Kojiroh] Do you happen to know a fat Chinese dude?
[Prisia] A fat Chinese dude?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Prisia] I don't know.
[Kojiroh] So, you don't know who has the damn\thing...
[Prisia] It could be anyone.
[Kojiroh] I'm sure that's why Kou was killed...\There's no doubt about it.
[Prisia] He died protecting the National Seal...
[Kojiroh] Should I call you Purin or Prisia?
[Prisia] Either one will do. Whatever you prefer...
[Kojiroh] Mind if I call you Purin?
[Prisia] Not at all.
[Kojiroh] Who do you think killed Kou? Well,\"Terror" is the assassin who killed him... But who\hired the assassin?
[Prisia] It was undoubtedly a member of the reform\party.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Prisia] Stoleman knew that he was in a dangerous\situation. We were trying to come up with an\imitation, and that's when we lost contact with\him.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Prisia] There are some radical reforms occurring\in the Eldian Republic.
[Kojiroh] I heard.
[Prisia] After the previous king passed away, our\nation is rapidly incorporating democracy.
[Prisia] Prime Minister Lloyd has taken leadership,\and wants to end the monarchy. She plans to govern\under the command of the cabinet.
[Kojiroh] So, the nation is swaying towards a\democratic government.
[Prisia] That could very well be, if the people\want that.
[Kojiroh] What do you think?
[Prisia] Once the wave of democracy begins, there\is no stopping it. But the people need to be\properly educated about the advantages and\disadvantages.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Prisia] If they don't... The people will be ruled\by the government.
[Kojiroh] What does the Prime Minister - I mean,\the reform party plan to do?
[Prisia] The reform party wants to sell Eldia to\other countries to be controlled.
[Kojiroh] Sell the country?
[Prisia] That is correct. Some politicians are\trying to make money by sacrificing their\countrymen.
[Kojiroh] But those bastards need Eldia to maintain\their power, right? If Eldia is controlled by some\other country then...
[Prisia] Eldia will survive as another country's\territory.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Prisia] I hope to avoid that. I can't stop the\people from wanting democracy... But I think\they're moving too fast... I don't think they're\ready for it.
[Kojiroh] But if you become the Queen...
[Prisia] That's right. That's why they want to stop\my commemoration ceremony at all costs.
[Kojiroh] Are you the King's daughter?
[Prisia] No, the King didn't leave any heirs. I am\his niece.
[Kojiroh] I see... So you're blood relatives.
[Prisia] It's an old method... But that's the way\it is.
[Kojiroh] Okay, so the reform party is gonna try to\interrupt the commemoration tomorrow?
[Prisia] I don't think so. I think they're going to\let someone else take the Queen's position with the\National Seal.
[Kojiroh] Who?
[Prisia] According to Stoleman, the person is\Ambassador Mido's daughter.
[Kojiroh] What!?!
[Kojiroh] (That would be Mayako Mido...)
[Kojiroh] (She's going to be the Queen...?)
[Prisia] I am to become the next Queen of Eldia.
[Kojiroh] The next queen?
[Prisia] But it's top secret. It will be announced\during tomorrow's commemoration.
[Kojiroh] Tomorrow? Then what the hell are you\doing here...?
[Prisia] The commemoration will take place on the\Tristan.
[Kojiroh] The what...?
[Prisia] Tristan. It's the boat you can see from\your office.
[Kojiroh] You mean that ship's an Eldian cruiser?
[Prisia] I gave the boat its name.
[Kojiroh] What does Tristan mean?
[Prisia] It's a character's name in a classic.
[Kojiroh] You're such a romantic.
[Prisia] I do my best.
[Kojiroh] Why is everyone so secretive about you\becoming the next queen?
[Prisia] Because if I become the Queen, there would\be an internal conflict within the government.
[Kojiroh] You mean, like a domestic dispute?
[Prisia] I guess you can call it a simple struggle\for power.
[Kojiroh] I see.
[Prisia] The only ones who knew this was Stoleman\and those who work for the royal family.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Prisia] Stoleman used a drug on me when I arrived\in Japan, about one week before the commemoration.
[Kojiroh] Drug?
[Prisia] A drug that his father made. It puts the\person under a heavy hypnosis of some kind.
[Kojiroh] His father was the Chief of the Science\Ministry...right?
[Prisia] That's right.
[Kojiroh] What sort of drug was it?
[Prisia] I don't know the actual, technical name...\But if you use them, you can cover up your real\personality.
[Kojiroh] So it is hypnosis...
[Prisia] It's stronger than hypnosis, though. It\can work on anyone.
[Kojiroh] I see... And this is what's happened with\you and Purin.
[Prisia] Therefore, I became Purin rather than\Prisia. And instead of the queen, I'm became a\servant to the queen.
[Kojiroh] I see... So this way, no one knows where\the future queen is.
[Prisia] When you take this drug, you also\incorporate a keyword which acts as a switch to\come out of the hypnotic state.
[Kojiroh] Could it be a stanza from that poem?
[Prisia] Yes... My mother read me that stanza to me\when I was a child.
[Kojiroh] But nothing happened when I showed you\the note that time.
[Prisia] Merely looking at it has no effect. I have\to hear it.
[Kojiroh] Oh... That's why.
[Prisia] Yes... I put the poem around the doll's\neck for someone to read.
[Kojiroh] What if no one read the stanza...
[Prisia] I would forever be Purin...
[Kojiroh] Wow...
[Prisia] ...
[Kojiroh] And you said, it affects anyone?
[Prisia] Yes.
[Kojiroh] That's some dangerous shit...
[Prisia] That's right.
[Kojiroh] So there are others who think the same?
[Prisia] We first thought it might be useful in the\medical field. But the former Intelligence Sector\wanted to use it during interrogations.
[Kojiroh] You said that it was created by the\Ministry of Science.
[Prisia] That's right. Stoleman's father was the\creator.
[Kojiroh] Could that possibly be the Project C?
[Prisia] What's that?
[Kojiroh] Haven't you heard it?
[Prisia] No.
[Kojiroh] Oh.
[Prisia] ...
[Kojiroh] You said your name was Prisia... Didn't\you?
[Prisia] Yes.
[Kojiroh] Are you sure you're not... Purin?
[Prisia] Purin and I are the same person. Purin is\just one of the personalities that I was given.
[Kojiroh] You were given a personality?
[Prisia] I should probably start explaining things\from the beginning.
[Kojiroh] You know who I am, don't you...
[Prisia] Yes. Purin's memories are mine as well.\Everything she remembers, I remember.

[Purin] That poem?
[Kojiroh] Yeah, the one on the note I showed you.

[Purin] I'm scared...
[Kojiroh] Purin...
[Purin] I feel so... Strange...

[Kojiroh] Make up your mind.
[Purin] I just don't know... I feel weird. I just\don't know!!

[Kojiroh] (A rather chic room.)
[Kojiroh] (But is someone sitting on that chair...)
[Kojiroh] (She must be sleeping.)
[Kojiroh] (What could she be doing?)
[Kojiroh] (Why doesn't she respond to me...?)
[Kojiroh] (Someone's there...)
[Kojiroh] (Long blonde hair... Could that be the\high-class, noble person?)
[Kojiroh] (It looks like a woman from here...)
[Kojiroh] (Purin is silent.)
[Kojiroh] (What's Purin so afraid of...?)
[Kojiroh] (This isn't that scary...)
[Kojiroh] (She's frozen stiff...)
[Kojiroh] (The lights are burning dim.)
[Kojiroh] (The lights sure aren't very bright.)
[Kojiroh] (It's the living room.)

[Kojiroh] (What are you doing?)
