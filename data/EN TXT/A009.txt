[Akane] Hey, Kojiroh! What are you doing here?
[Kojiroh] Ditto.
[Akane] Unlike you, I'm here to gather information.\I'm very busy, you know.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, yeah. Damn, you gonna eat all that?
[Akane] Yeah... You gotta problem with that?
[Kojiroh] Don't you ever eat anything besides\vegetables?
[Akane] No. You have a problem with that?
[Kojiroh] You're in a cocktail lounge. Drink\something.
[Akane] Yeah, yeah.
[Kojiroh] There's something I've been meaning to\ask you.
[Akane] What would that be?
[Kojiroh] Do you only eat the things that cows eat?
[Akane] Haven't you ever heard of a vegetarian?
[Kojiroh] Listen, babe... I'll give you a real\tasty slab of meat.
[Akane] Oh yeah?
[Kojiroh] Yeah. You could use some prime prick in\your diet.
[Akane] I may vomit, you know.
[Kojiroh] Don't worry, it shouldn't taste that bad.\Maybe just a little salty. And then bitter.
[Akane] I've been doing just fine on a diet\consisting of greens. It's healthy.
[Kojiroh] Just think of my meat as a carrot, or an\eggplant.
[Akane] I'll think about it.
[Kojiroh] Meat is what makes the world go round...\You'll love it.
[Akane] Does your meat have any bones?
[Kojiroh] It's only got one. One big, fat,\succulent bone.
[Akane] Well, I'm afraid I might choke on such a\bone.
[Kojiroh] I'll make sure you don't.
[Akane] How is the meat cooked?
[Kojiroh] Uhh, let's just say it'll be well done.\And trust me, you will do it well.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] Come on, let's have a drink.
[Akane] I'm not a big drinker.
[Kojiroh] Don't worry. Shot glasses are small.
[Akane] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] Unfortunately, there aren't many women in\this place.
[Akane] Yeah. Too bad.
[Kojiroh] But check her out... She's got a nice\ass.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] We should curse God for not creating all\women equal... Eh?
*splash!*
[Kojiroh] Wow... She just threw her drink at him.
[Akane] Go girl...
[Kojiroh] She looks scary... Maybe she's dumping\him, or something.
[Akane] ...
[Kojiroh] The man got up from his seat... He's\coming this way.
Bam.

[Akane] I just remembered that I have to do\something... Bye.
[Kojiroh] Hey, wait a minute...

[Kojiroh] What's gotten into her?
[Kojiroh] She just took off like a bat out of hell.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Woman's voice] Sorry.
b18
[Kojiroh] Hi... (Hey that's the girl who just threw\her drink.)
[Kojiroh] (She's a... foreigner.)
[Kojiroh] (But that's not so rare in this country\anymore.)
[Kojiroh] (And besides... This is the Princess\Hotel.)
[Woman] I like to apologize on behalf of my...\Acquaintance bumping into you.
[Kojiroh] Oh, don't worry about it.
[Woman] I guess you saw it, huh?
[Kojiroh] Hey, we all have times when we want to\throw drinks at people.
[Woman] I was a little upset.
[Kojiroh] (She's pretty drunk...)
[Kojiroh] (Her pretty little face is red... But\she's still quite beautiful.)
[Kojiroh] (...)
[Kojiroh] (Even I feel a little irritated.)
[Kojiroh] (I lost my target... There're no leads...\Everything's going wrong.)
[Woman] Sorry, I've got plans to attend to.
[Kojiroh] Plans?
[Woman] I have to go wash my hands.
[Kojiroh] You can do it over at the counter.
[Woman] And then I'd like to take a hot shower and\relax.
[Kojiroh] Try to stay here and relax a little\while.
[Woman] ...
[Kojiroh] Come on, don't look so angry.
[Woman] How do you just expect me to relax so\easily... Ah...
She staggers.

\ 
[Kojiroh] Hey, are you alright?
[Woman] I'm just tired, that's all...
b18
[Woman] Thank you... My, what strong arms you have.
[Kojiroh] I've got another thing I can show you\too.
[Woman] It's a shame I won't get to watch it\slither...
[Kojiroh] Why not? Come on, babe... Watch it\slither right up your leg.
[Woman] ...
[Kojiroh] Oh, come on. You've gotta such beautiful\face... Don't ruin it like that.
[Woman] You are a funny guy... funny and impolite.
[Kojiroh] I get that a lot, thanks.
[Woman] I don't think you're helping me relax any.
[Kojiroh] You haven't really tried yet.
[Woman] ...
[Kojiroh] Your smile is shinier than a sunny\stream.
[Woman] Please... Enough of your attempts at\seduction.
[Kojiroh] I'm not doing well, am I...?
[Woman] Let's just say you'll be beating off\tonight.
[Kojiroh] I see...
[Woman] I was planning on relaxing after a nice hot\shower...
[Kojiroh] Well?
[Woman] But drinking here has proven quite\interesting.
[Kojiroh] I'm honored.
[Woman] You won't persist with the perverse\comments, will you?
[Kojiroh] Not at all.
[Woman] How do I know I can trust you?
[Kojiroh] All I can do is promise. Will you at\least trust me with your name?
[Woman] Okay... I'm Aqua.
[Kojiroh] Aqua?
[Aqua] That's right.
[Kojiroh] I like that name. Three "A's" in one\name.
[Aqua] Thanks.
[Kojiroh] I'm Kojiroh. Kojiroh Amagi.
[Aqua] Kojiroh... That's a nice name... Here, have\a seat.

[Glen] Call me if you need anything, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] Sure thing.
[Glen] Okay, so you already knew about the girl...\So I'll only charge you one information fee. Heh,\heh, heh...
[Kojiroh] What?
[Glen] You've got those eyes again.
[Kojiroh] ...Eyes?
[Glen] It's nothing.
[Kojiroh] Glen.
[Glen] Yeah?
[Kojiroh] Let me know if the girl is found.
[Glen] If the girl is found?
[Kojiroh] Yeah.
[Glen] If someone else finds her, then there's no\more reward though.
[Kojiroh] Even so, come to me right away with the\info.
[Glen] Oh, you gonna take the girl, huh?
[Kojiroh] I'll give you the reward.
[Glen] Well, in that case...
009
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Glen's gone.
[Kojiroh] An assassins who uses a knife...
[Kojiroh] Where are you, Purin...? And what are you\doing...?
[Kojiroh] ...
eve_09
[Glen] Heh, heh, heh...
[Kojiroh] What's so funny?
[Glen] Maybe I should let you in on some\information...
[Kojiroh] Will it help?
[Glen] It's safe work and easy money.
[Kojiroh] Well I work for the fun of it. Not just\to make a quick buck.
[Glen] Do you want it or not?
[Kojiroh] I'll decide after I hear about it.
[Glen] Very well, then.
[Kojiroh] What's the information about?
[Glen] It's about a reward.
[Kojiroh] Reward?
[Glen] Yeah. I just got this info from one of my\contacts yesterday.
[Kojiroh] Is this about that assassin...?
[Glen] That's a little too dangerous to handle.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] Although there's a reward out for the\assassin too, but...
[Kojiroh] So it's another guy. But it's not easy,\right?
[Glen] Well, it doesn't sound bad for the money\they're willing to dish out...
[Kojiroh] Just tell me how much the reward is and\on who?
[Glen] The reward is $50,000.
[Kojiroh] That ain't bad.
[Glen] The only problem is, I don't know the\target's name.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] But I do know the physical characteristics.
[Kojiroh] Don't just sit there, man! Tell me what\they are.
[Glen] Hold on, it's written on my note\somewhere... Here it is.
[Kojiroh] And?
[Glen] Here goes... The subject has blonde hair,\big eyes, and tan skin. The age is estimated to be\late teens.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] What's the matter? You look sick...
[Kojiroh] Uh, no... It's just... There are girls\like that everywhere you look. It'll be hard to\find her.
[Glen] Hey... I never mentioned whether the target\was male or female.
[Kojiroh] (Oops...)
[Glen] But you guessed right. The target is female.\Do you know her?
[Kojiroh] I don't know any girls that fit that\description. It'll be hard work.
[Glen] There's one more physical feature...
[Kojiroh] What's that...?
[Glen] It should narrow down the odds a bit, too...
[Kojiroh] It's not about the eyes, is it?
[Glen] You're on a roll today... Her left eye is\blue, and her right is gold.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] You should've told me if you already heard\about it... Kojiroh?
[Kojiroh] ...What?
[Glen] What's gotten into you? You look as if\you've seen a ghost.
[Kojiroh] I was just wondering... Who the hell\wants to put a price out on a girl like that?
[Glen] I don't know...
[Kojiroh] Well, then how the hell did you find out?\How in the hell do I get the money if I find her?
[Glen] The newspaper.
[Kojiroh] You've gotta be kidding...
[Glen] There's a contact address in the newspaper\for anyone who finds the target.
[Kojiroh] I see... So once I find her, I'd contact\the address in the paper for the fifty grand.
[Glen] That's right. When I got to work this\morning, our info lines were clogged with people\looking for that blonde.
[Kojiroh] So everyone knows this information?
[Glen] Yeah. They've all turned into bloodthirsty\hounds.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] Is something wrong? You seem nervous.
[Kojiroh] No, nothing...
[Glen] Well, does this sound like something you'd\be willing to work on?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I still don't get it... Why is Nikaido on\the most wanted list if they already know who\killed Kou?
[Glen] That's the way cops are handling it.
[Kojiroh] So you're saying some other organization,\other than the cops, are moving?
[Glen] It's just a rumor I heard... But let me warn\you...
[Kojiroh] What?
[Glen] This one's really dangerous.
[Kojiroh] How so?
[Glen] This is all unconfirmed, so I don't know how\much of this I can say...
[Kojiroh] I'm listening...
[Glen] I'll let you in on something...
[Kojiroh] Spill the beans.
[Glen] There are others working on it... Not just\the cops in Japan, but another organization.
[Kojiroh] Wow...
[Glen] A group even scarier than the cops.
[Kojiroh] So you want me to pull out?
[Glen] No, no...
[Kojiroh] Then what are you trying to say?
[Glen] It's just that, if something happens to you,\then I'll be losing a valuable customer.
[Kojiroh] Thanks.
[Glen] Let's just call it "Give and Take".
[Kojiroh] Whatever you say.
[Glen] ...
[Kojiroh] Well, don't worry about it. I don't plan\on sticking my head where it doesn't belong.
[Glen] ...
[Kojiroh] The only reason why I wanted the\information was because there was something bugging\me. That's all. But now, I'm pulling out.
[Glen] Heh, heh, heh... I'm relieved to hear that.
[Kojiroh] Is that all the information you have?
[Glen] Yes, that's all.
[Kojiroh] That's all you got for me?
[Glen] Oh, come on...
[Kojiroh] Yeah, never mind.
[Kojiroh] (Man...)
[Kojiroh] (If what Glen said is true, I'm seriously\in deep shit.)
[Kojiroh] (But then...)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] Our information lines are jammed with this\news...
[Kojiroh] So who is this guy?
[Glen] Some guy who's been messing around in the\Middle East.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] They say this assassin never uses a gun.
[Kojiroh] How does he kill people without a gun?
[Glen] He uses a knife.
[Kojiroh] A knife!?!
[Glen] Heh, heh, heh... That seems to interest\you...
[Kojiroh] Nah, the word just brings back memories\of my circumcision, that's all.
[Glen] Unfortunately, there isn't nearly enough\information about this killer.
[Kojiroh] Why not.
[Glen] Actually, most of us are too scared to get\close enough to know anything. Some of us aren't\circumcised.
[Kojiroh] Well, what do you know?
[Glen] He kills with the same type of knife every\time, and always leaves the knife next to his\victim.
[Kojiroh] The guy likes to show off, eh?
[Glen] Uh, I guess you could say that.
[Kojiroh] Does his knife have a black handle.
[Glen] Yes... It's the knife distributed in the\Eldian military.
[Kojiroh] So I guess I can't get one on my own.
[Glen] I don't suppose so.
[Kojiroh] How are the assassin and the military\connected? Is there some sort of military plot?
[Glen] That's been ruled out.
[Kojiroh] Why?
[Glen] Because the assassin murdered someone in the\Eldian Republic.
[Kojiroh] Who did he kill?
[Glen] The King.
[Kojiroh] Oh my God...
[Glen] He's wanted by the government.
[Kojiroh] So why the hell did the bastard come to\Japan?
[Glen] The answer, my friend, is blowing in the\wind. No one knows.
[Kojiroh] And he killed Kou?
[Glen] That's what the Japanese National\Investigation Team thinks.
[Kojiroh] (An assassin who kills with a knife...\I've never heard of such a thing.)
[Kojiroh] (A knife...)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Do you know who killed Kou?
[Glen] I can't verify it... But I have it narrowed\down.
[Kojiroh] What the hell does that shit mean?
[Glen] Well, are you interested in buying the\information?
[Kojiroh] Sure, why not.
[Glen] Heh, heh, heh... You're wise to be so quick\with your decisions.
[Kojiroh] Hey, any info is good info. I'll pay if I\have to, to get it.
[Glen] This issue involves a Middle Eastern\assassin.
[Kojiroh] Did I ever tell you how much I like the\word assassin? There are two asses in it.
[Glen] Uh, well, yes... There are.
[Kojiroh] The word fits the person, doesn't it? A\killer is most definitely an ass.
[Glen] You have a point there.
[Kojiroh] Is this assassin a professional?
[Glen] Of the highest degree.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Why would a professional assassin go\after Kou?)
[Kojiroh] (This doesn't make sense.)
[Glen] But now I finally understood why you asked\me that question.
[Kojiroh] What do you mean?
[Glen] Oh, please... You asked me about a man named\Kou before.
[Kojiroh] Oh, yeah.
[Glen] And now everyone knows that name. You're on\a big case, aren't you?
[Kojiroh] It's just a coincidence.
[Glen] Your rival is Katsuragi Private Detective\Offices, isn't it...?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] They've just been dealt a blow... Your rival\shouldn't be so tough now.
[Kojiroh] Stick to the subject. I'm not paying for\your extra observations.
[Glen] Heh, heh, heh... You're not in a very good\mood today, are you...?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] Well then, let me begin with the\information.
[Kojiroh] By all means, get on with it.
[Glen] I shouldn't be telling anyone this, not even\for a price... But it's important.
[Kojiroh] Is it about Kou?
[Glen] Guess again... It's about the killer.
[Kojiroh] ...?!

[Glen] Hey, it's up to you.
[Kojiroh] Alright. Keep talking.
[Glen] You got it.
[Kojiroh] I'm not sure what it is, but there's\something grabbing my attention. Call it an\intuition.
[Glen] You're wise... You've been such a generous\customer, I'll give you a free bit of information.
[Kojiroh] What is it?
[Glen] It's about your rival detective agency.
[Kojiroh] My rival?
[Glen] Katsuragi Private Detective Offices.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] I've heard that they screwed up big time.
[Kojiroh] So?
[Glen] It's an ugly situation over there...
[Kojiroh] What do you mean, ugly? I've seen a few\pieces of ass working there.
[Glen] I'm speaking in terms of management. Not\ass.
[Kojiroh] How bad is it?
[Glen] Well, they're in a worse situation since you\beat them on the case.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] So how about it? Will it help you to destroy\your rivals?
[Kojiroh] Destroy my rivals...?
[Glen] Oh yeah... That's your former place of\business.
[Kojiroh] Hey... None of those crap. I'll buy your\information.
[Glen] Heh, heh, heh... Good choice.

[Glen] Congratulations on getting the case.
[Kojiroh] I was just lucky.
[Glen] How modest of you.
[Kojiroh] So what have you got for me?
[Glen] You only have to pay me if you like what you\hear.
[Kojiroh] Fine.
[Glen] There's an amusing anecdote about that\painting...
[Kojiroh] An amusing anecdote?
[Glen] You heard correct.
[Kojiroh] It's not a curse, is it?
[Glen] How'd you know?
[Kojiroh] I did some research at the library. I\learned that anyone carrying that painting is bound\to die.
[Glen] You always did keep up on your homework.
[Kojiroh] You weren't too helpful with that\so-called "info." I already knew it.
[Glen] Well, you're a smart cookie.
[Kojiroh] Eat me.
[Glen] Heh, heh, heh...
[Kojiroh] What's the matter with you? You keep\laughing like a complete imbecile.
[Glen] Never mind that. By the way... Did you\notice something odd...?
[Kojiroh] Besides your ridiculous laugh? No. What\could it be?
[Glen] It's about that waitress you hate so much.
[Kojiroh] I'd rather not hear about it, if you\don't mind. She makes my balls shrivel.
[Glen] Well, she seems to be taking a break at the\moment.
[Kojiroh] That's the best news you've told me all\day.
[Glen] I personally found her quite amusing.
[Kojiroh] I'll never get to where you're at, pal.
[Glen] Heh, heh, heh...

[Glen] I'm not hiding anything at all.
[Kojiroh] As always, this place is nearly empty.
[Kojiroh] I like it that way.
[Kojiroh] It's comfortable and quiet here.
[Glen] And thank God there aren't any children\here.
[Kojiroh] This guy's a bit overly cautious.
[Kojiroh] I don't know his real name or his\address. I don't know anything about him.
[Kojiroh] Whenever we plan to meet somewhere, he's\sure to get there first.
[Kojiroh] But I understand where he's coming from.
[Glen] And thanks to that, I'm always in perfect\health...
[Kojiroh] It's booze... Bourbon, perhaps?
[Glen] Why not have a drink, Kojiroh?
[Kojiroh] Hey, what do you usually drink?
[Glen] Heh, heh, heh... Bourbon. Always.
[Kojiroh] I see...
[Glen] I love drinking alcohol that smells like the\fields.

[Kojiroh] There doesn't appear to be a waitress\around.
[Kojiroh] To hell with it. I don't need to order\anything.
[Kojiroh] How about the whiskey...
She puts a glass on the table.
[Kojiroh] Hey, she served me a glass in no time.
[Kojiroh] She's a damn good bartender.
[Kojiroh] But that rude cow told me they didn't\have any whiskey.
[Kojiroh] Ah, to hell with it. I don't need to\order anything.
[Kojiroh] Wine, does a darn good job of stimulating\my romantic side.
[Kojiroh] That's right, I wanted wine.
[Kojiroh] I'd like some of that wine that goes down\red and comes out yellow.
She puts a glass on my table.
[Kojiroh] Wow. The service here ain't so bad.
I swallow the whole glass.
[Kojiroh] Is this really the stuff I ordered?
[Kojiroh] Ah, to hell with it. I don't need to\order anything.
[Kojiroh] Beef!
She puts the bowl on my table.

[Kojiroh] Shall I order?
[Kojiroh] I love looking at all those bottles lined\up over there... Ah, the possibilities.

[Kojiroh] I just might be able to steal one for\myself.

[Aqua] ...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Oh, shit!)
[Kojiroh] (That incident back there...)
[Kojiroh] (Oh, man... After that, anything's\possible.)
[Aqua] ...
[Kojiroh] Please excuse me for being so\inconsiderate.
[Aqua] Don't worry... I never pay much attention to\things like that.
[Kojiroh] Oh.
[Aqua] But any more and I'll never forgive you.
[Kojiroh] You have my word on it.
[Aqua] By the way, Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Yeah?
[Aqua] It was fun... I haven't laughed this much in\ages.
[Kojiroh] Really...?
[Aqua] Well, it's time to go to bed. Oh, waitress,\could you clean the table for us... Thank you.

[Kojiroh] You okay? You're staggering a little.
[Aqua] I may seem drunk, but I'm fine. I'm pretty\strong when it comes to alcohol.
[Kojiroh] That's good.
[Aqua] What's wrong? You don't look too happy to\hear that.
[Kojiroh] I just hope we'll run into each other\again. Here, maybe?
[Aqua] Who knows...
[Kojiroh] Don't push yourself...
[Aqua] Well, I do come here when I want to drink.
[Kojiroh] Good. Maybe I'll see you again.
[Aqua] I hope so... Maslama.

[Kojiroh] ...Maslama?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] This is a good diversion, don't you\think?
[Kojiroh] I mean, drinking like this...
[Kojiroh] But who was that guy you were with?
[Kojiroh] No one special.
[Kojiroh] Someone from work?
[Kojiroh] I'm only curious, that's all.
[Aqua] Did I ever tell you how much I enjoy\children?
[Kojiroh] No, but why?
[Aqua] They're both cute and annoying...
[Kojiroh] Ohh... (She didn't seem like she enjoyed\anything just a minute ago.)
[Aqua] I like people who are pure and honest.
[Kojiroh] Oh, then you might not like me at all.
[Aqua] Is that so?
[Kojiroh] Yeah. I'm a vulgar, perverted, selfish\idiot.
[Aqua] Well, you do give off that impression. But\I'm sure there's a good person underneath all of\that.
[Kojiroh] I wish there was a good person underneath\me, too. One with a good ass.
[Aqua] Did you know that I have a child?
[Kojiroh] What?!
[Aqua] Aren't you overreacting just a bit?
[Kojiroh] I'm so sorry... I thought you were some\kind of a debutante.
[Aqua] Oh, really?
[Kojiroh] Well, no... That's not what I mean...\(Good going...)
[Aqua] Are you disappointed?
[Kojiroh] Hell no! Love sees no status.
[Aqua] *chuckle*
[Kojiroh] But...
[Aqua] But what?
[Kojiroh] But shouldn't you be married?
[Aqua] I don't have to be married...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Aqua] I hate to break the news to you, but the\sperm and egg aren't too concerned about whether or\not there's a ring on my finger.
[Kojiroh] You're right. Biology doesn't have any\morals.
[Aqua] You could put it that way.
[Kojiroh] Alright, then let me list up... Say four\possibilities.
[Aqua] Trying to show off your detective side, huh?
[Kojiroh] Something like that.
[Aqua] Alright, go ahead.
[Kojiroh] First possibility... You untied the knot.
[Aqua] Untied the knot?
[Kojiroh] Yeah... Like a divorce.
[Aqua] Oh, okay... How about possibility two?
[Kojiroh] Hey, I didn't get to hear if my first\guess was right or not.
[Aqua] I'll tell you after you tell me all of them.
[Kojiroh] Okay. The second possibility is adoption.
[Aqua] Even though the parents aren't married?
[Kojiroh] Wake up! It's the nineties, you know.
[Aqua] Oh yeah... Well, how about the third\possibility?
[Kojiroh] This one's more common... A single\mother.
[Aqua] Oh yes.
[Kojiroh] She miscalculates her ovulation and ends\up pregnant. That could happen, right?
[Aqua] It happens all too often... Do you know this\from experience?
[Kojiroh] Do I look like I do?
[Aqua] You'd better not ask. You might not hear the\answer you want.
[Kojiroh] Virtually everything women tell me is\something I'd rather not hear.
[Aqua] *chuckle*
[Kojiroh] Anyway...
[Aqua] But I don't think I'm far off.
[Kojiroh] Let's change the subject.
[Aqua] Yeah, there are some things no one wants to\be asked.
[Kojiroh] (Those are my favorite questions to ask!)
[Aqua] ...You're not going to ask me, are you?
[Kojiroh] About what?
[Aqua] You know...
[Kojiroh] If you're in trouble with the guy wearing\glasses?
[Aqua] Yes.
[Kojiroh] If I ask you, are you going to answer me?
[Aqua] ...
[Kojiroh] This conversation is raining all over our\picnic, isn't it...
[Aqua] I'm still happy you tried cheering me up,\though.
[Kojiroh] Let's talk about something else.
[Aqua] Like what?
[Kojiroh] Well, I want to ask you something.
[Aqua] Make sure it's something I won't mind\answering.
[Kojiroh] Are you single?
[Aqua] Are you criticizing my morals? I should've\known.
[Kojiroh] Believe me, I'm not one to talk when it\comes to morals... I'm just trying to ask you on a\date, that's all.
[Aqua] Really?
[Kojiroh] Yes. I think you're beautiful.
[Aqua] You're not the first one to tell me that,\you know...
[Kojiroh] And I'm sure I won't be the last...
[Aqua] Ha ha... You're an interesting fellow.
[Kojiroh] Well, what's your answer?
[Aqua] Well... I usually just tell guys that I'm\already married.
[Kojiroh] How about to me?
[Aqua] To you... It's a secret.
[Kojiroh] Ah, come on...
[Aqua] You're an investigator, right? Figure it out\on your own.
[Kojiroh] Maybe you are married, and you have a\kid... Is that it?
[Aqua] ...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Uh-oh... Did I say something wrong?)
[Kojiroh] (Or, was it true?)
[Aqua] You know, Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Yes?
[Aqua] You seem like a very busy person as well.
[Kojiroh] I do get enough time to speak to\beautiful women.
[Aqua] What do you do?
[Kojiroh] You mean, my job?
[Aqua] Yes.
[Kojiroh] I just go around people's homes and look\at their stuff.
[Aqua] You're not a cop, are you?
[Kojiroh] Are you kidding? I hate cops more than I\hate broccoli.
[Aqua] Is that so...
[Kojiroh] But that doesn't necessarily make me a\criminal, either.
[Aqua] I wonder.
[Kojiroh] Come on, you know I'd never do anything\illegal.
[Aqua] I see, you're from a detective agency,\right?
[Kojiroh] Well... Not quite.
[Aqua] Tell me what you do.
[Kojiroh] I'm a private detective.
[Aqua] A private...detective?
[Kojiroh] I bet I can even guess the color of your\underwear.
[Aqua] Don't bother.
[Kojiroh] Listen, I'm not here to investigate\anything.
[Aqua] How do I know?
[Kojiroh] My license has been revoked.
[Aqua] So you're just screwing around?
[Kojiroh] That's right. In the figurative sense, of\course.
[Aqua] At least you're honest.
[Kojiroh] Even detectives need their own time. It's\not like in the movies, where all they do is\investigate crimes.
[Kojiroh] Aqua... I like that name.
[Aqua] Me too.
[Kojiroh] What ever happened to thanking people who\compliment you?
[Aqua] Thanks. Thanks a million.
[Kojiroh] (I think I'm blowing it.)
[Kojiroh] You're a foreigner, aren't you?
[Aqua] Yes, but I do have the proper visa to be\here. I'm perfectly legal.
[Kojiroh] I didn't mean to ask so rudely... I\wasn't accusing you of being illegal.
[Aqua] I know... I just wanted to tease you.
[Kojiroh] You're sharp.
[Aqua] Are you giving me some sort of a test?
[Kojiroh] No... I'm just surprised. You don't seem\very foreign at all.
[Aqua] Your definition of a foreigner is anyone not\Japanese, right?
[Kojiroh] ...Yeah, that's my definition.
[Aqua] Well, I'm a foreigner. I was born and raised\overseas.
[Kojiroh] Are you here as a tourist?
[Aqua] What do you think?
[Kojiroh] Listen, I'm just nervous about asking\where you're from.
[Aqua] From a land far, far away.
[Kojiroh] Where no man has gone before?
[Aqua] Well, you probably haven't been there.
[Kojiroh] Probably not.
[Aqua] But maybe you'll get over there someday.
[Kojiroh] I expect you to show me around if I do.
[Aqua] I'd be happy to.
[Kojiroh] (Although your eyes say no...)
[Aqua] Is something the matter...?
[Aqua] Perhaps we should order something.
[Aqua] Shouldn't we order something first?
[Kojiroh] Why?
[Aqua] That cute waitress is looking over this way.
[Kojiroh] Uh-oh...
[Kojiroh] You're a tough woman, Aqua.
[Aqua] I don't know about that... That was the\first time I've ever done that.
[Kojiroh] Wow...
[Kojiroh] (So she must've been really pissed off.)
[Aqua] But if you do it once, it's easy to do it a\second time.
[Kojiroh] Is that a warning?
[Aqua] That's for me to know and you to find out.
[Kojiroh] I'll try to keep that in mind.
[Aqua] Thanks... I wouldn't want to get that nice\jacket dirty.
[Kojiroh] (She's putting her guard up.)

[Kojiroh] I don't want to get all drunk and make an\ass out of myself.
[Kojiroh] No beer tonight.
[Kojiroh] Booze...?
[Kojiroh] I don't want to get drunk right now.
[Aqua] Do you have a low alcohol tolerance? I never\would've guessed.
[Kojiroh] My tolerance is fine... But I find your\looks so much more intoxicating than a glass of\liquor.
[Aqua] I'm flattered.
[Kojiroh] ...Really?
[Aqua] It takes a lot of talent to say an old\cliche so genuinely.
[Kojiroh] Oh. (This woman's hard to please.)
[Aqua] Anyway, I like men who are straight forward.
[Kojiroh] I already ordered.
[Kojiroh] I don't want to order again.
[Kojiroh] Beer nuts? Nah, I don't want to order\anything at the moment.
[Aqua] If you order something, get me one too.
[Kojiroh] I think you've had enough.
[Aqua] ...Excuse me?
[Kojiroh] You're right. We can't just sit here\without ordering anything.
[Kojiroh] Hey, waitress!
She comes over to the table.
[Kojiroh] (Here goes nothing.)

[Aqua] Please forget about that. It's embarrassing.

[Kojiroh] You're one foxy mama in that sweater.
[Aqua] Thank you. I always wear the best designs.
[Kojiroh] Those eyes are deep brown... Different\from most women I know.
[Kojiroh] She's so cool and sophisticated.
[Kojiroh] She smells like a beautiful maiden out of\a children's fairytale.
[Aqua] What are you thinking about? You're staring\at me in a daze...
[Kojiroh] I don't feel like drinking now.

[Kojiroh] And if the painting never hits the black\market.
[Glen] That means this Kou character's looking for\something worthless.
[Kojiroh] That's too bad.
[Glen] Shit happens. A lot of people get tricked\into buying something worthless.
[Kojiroh] Yeah...
[Glen] I try to keep my opinions out of the art\world. The only thing I can trust is the quality of\information.
[Kojiroh] When do you expect the latest info to\leak?
[Glen] Maybe tonight.
[Kojiroh] That would be a big help.
[Glen] Then we'll talk business...

[Kojiroh] (This case is more interesting to me than\O.J. was to Ito.)
[Kojiroh] (My instincts are always right on the bad\things.)
[Kojiroh] (Hopefully, it doesn't turn out bad.)
[Kojiroh] Is there a movement within the brokers\who handle stolen arts?
[Glen] They're always on the move.
[Kojiroh] No, no. Like if there was anything\especially valuable in their market.
[Glen] Could you be more specific?

[Kojiroh] He doesn't seem to know a thing about it.
[Kojiroh] Hey, Glen...
[Glen] Yeah?
[Kojiroh] Does the name "Kou" ring a bell?
[Glen] Kou...? Is that a first name? Last name? Is\that a nickname?
[Kojiroh] What am I, an encyclopedia? I have no\idea.
[Glen] Well, that's not enough to go on.
[Kojiroh] That name isn't floating around the black\market at all?
[Glen] Not as far as I know.
[Kojiroh] Any criminals with that name?
[Glen] Not that I know of.
[Kojiroh] How about the transvestites rounded up\last Monday?
[Glen] Nope. No Kou.
[Kojiroh] Is there a Kou who was blacklisted for\failure to pay rent?
[Glen] As far as I remember, no.
[Kojiroh] Is the name in the phone book?
[Glen] Look it up yourself.
[Kojiroh] Basically, you've never heard of the guy.
[Glen] Basically, yes.

[Kojiroh] For now, all I can do is wait for him to\follow through with the information.
[Kojiroh] But there was something else for me to\do... What was it...
[Glen] Keep listening.
[Glen] Please, keep listening.
[Glen] Okay, tell me what you know.
[Glen] The truth is...
[Kojiroh] Yeah?
[Glen] ...I've been getting busier and busier each\day.
[Kojiroh] That's more than I can say for myself...
[Glen] I've run into a big client. A real big one.
[Kojiroh] Well...?
[Glen] I'm willing to adjust my schedule as much as\possible. How about you?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] But I don't know how much I can help you\with your case.
[Kojiroh] Hey, just do what you can. I won't\pressure you.
[Glen] Thanks. I'll do whatever I can.
[Kojiroh] (A big client, eh?)
[Kojiroh] (Could it be someone in the Mafia? A\Manager from the black market?)
[Kojiroh] (Nah, I can't just ask him who it is.)
[Kojiroh] (That's not part of this business...)
[Glen] Heh, heh, heh...
[Kojiroh] What is it?
[Glen] I admire a man who doesn't ask questions\even when he really wants to.
[Kojiroh] Oh, thanks.
[Glen] Anyway...
[Kojiroh] Now, could you hear me out?
[Glen] Shoot.
[Glen] But first, let me give you something.
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah... Hey! Hey!!

He puts it out.
[Glen] I fixed the chamber...
[Kojiroh] Idiot... Don't leave it out in the open\like that.
[Glen] No one's around at the moment.
[Kojiroh] The waitress is right there.
[Glen] Even if someone did see it, they wouldn't\say anything. Would you, if you saw a guy like me\with a gun?
[Kojiroh] Uhh, no.
[Glen] Anyway, it's a Customized Glock 22. It's\illegal, but all the professionals carry one.
[Kojiroh] That's a relief.
mI hold it in my hand.
[Kojiroh] It sure is light. I can blast a cat to\smithereens during one of my bouts with\schizophrenia.
[Glen] Please, don't aim it at me.
[Kojiroh] I recognize this... This gun is handed\out to the Austrian military.
[Glen] Your eyes are gleaming with excitement.
[Kojiroh] What bullets do I use?
[Glen] Bullets? I'll give you plenty. I'll give you\40 S&W bullets. They'll rip through human bone and\eat all the meat off it as well.
[Kojiroh] You're a generous man.
[Glen] Don't mention it.

009b
[Kojiroh] Well?
[Glen] Well, what?
[Kojiroh] What do you want from me...
[Glen] Heh, heh, heh. You're always suspecting\greed in others, Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] That's because I'm usually right.
[Glen] It seems that big-boobied waitress has the\hots for you.
[Kojiroh] Quit your joking, man. That waitress\hates me more than you hate tardiness.
[Glen] Why?
[Kojiroh] She served me water and I told her off.
[Glen] You've got to learn to control your mouth\around women, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] I know... But they drive me so crazy!! I\love them to death.
[Glen] You'd better be careful or your death will\come sooner than you wish.
[Kojiroh] I love money and women. If it kills me,\it kills me.
[Glen] Speak of the devil...
[Kojiroh] Here she comes.

[Waitress] Can I take your order?
[Glen] I'll have one more bottle of the same...
[Waitress] And how about you?
[Kojiroh] I'd like a chunk of your ass.
[Waitress] Oh, my, God...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Waitress] Well, it's not on the menu.
She slaps me HARD.

[Kojiroh] ...
[Waitress] This place closes at 11.

She walks away.
[Glen] You okay? Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Jesus... I thought there was an\earthquake!
[Glen] No, there was no earthquake.
[Kojiroh] Damn, she put her weight on it.

　Glen
[Kojiroh] Although he's a low life... His\information can be trusted.
[Glen] Th... Thanks.
[Kojiroh] He's bald under the hat, and his\bloodshot eyes are under those sunglasses.
[Kojiroh] He's got bigger muscles than me and he\knows more than I do.
[Glen] Pardon me, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] It's Glen, the informant.
[Kojiroh] He knows everything about everyone. He\knew about the stain before Monica even wore the\dress.
[Kojiroh] I can trust what this guy tells me.
[Glen] Heh, heh... You know, trust is the most\important business factor.
[Kojiroh] This is one of my favorite bars.
[Kojiroh] Here I can drink long and slow... It's so\relaxing.
[Kojiroh] They've got every drink in the book, and\the interior design is cool.
[Glen] We can talk about anything in a place like\this.
[Kojiroh] I have to discuss work from now on... I'd\better not drink.
[Glen] Let me just have a little bit.
[Kojiroh] You seem to have already begun.
[Kojiroh] And as always, you're drinking bourbon.
[Glen] Well, I appreciate alcohol that comes from\the fields...
[Kojiroh] Nice interior... The ceiling fans aren't\moving right now.
[Kojiroh] They look like propellers... They're not\propelling shit right now, though.
[Kojiroh] Overall, I kinda like this atmosphere...
[Glen] It brings back feelings of the old days...
[Kojiroh] Yeah. Back when presidents didn't go to\court over domestic affairs.
[Kojiroh] Not too bright, not too dim... It's just\right.
[Kojiroh] This light is dim enough to make me look\relatively attractive.
[Kojiroh] This is the way every cocktail lounge\should be.
[Glen] I like this place, too.
　Go outside
　Hotel lobby
[Kojiroh] I'll go outside after while.
[Kojiroh] I'll talk to Glen first. Wait until I\finish.
[Glen] Let's relax, Kojiroh. Let's just both take\it easy.
[Kojiroh] I think it's best I stick around here for\a while.
[Kojiroh] There's nothing to do in the lobby.
[Glen] You haven't even heard what I have to say\yet.

[Kojiroh] Damn, where is he?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Waitress] Ready to order yet?
b20
[Kojiroh] Excuse me...
[Waitress] What do you want to order?
[Kojiroh] Listen, I'm not ready yet. Come on by\when my friend gets here. Is that too hard to ask?
[Waitress] Jesus...
[Kojiroh] (What the hell's happening to this\world!?!)
[Waitress] Ahem...
009
[Kojiroh] For Christ sake...
[Kojiroh] Shit! I wish Glen would hurry his ass up!
[Kojiroh] Thirty more seconds...
[Glen] Heh, heh, heh... Mind if I sit there,\Kojiroh?
[Kojiroh] Huh?
009b
[Kojiroh] Glen! Where the hell have you been...?
[Glen] I was just drinking in the booth beside you.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Glen] I make it a priority to get here before the\person I'm meeting.
[Kojiroh] The least you could do is tell me you're\here!
[Glen] I'm free to do what I want until it's our\meeting time. I enjoy relaxing.
[Kojiroh] Whatever, man...
[Glen] What's the matter?
[Kojiroh] You may enjoy making people wait for you,\but it ain't one of my hobbies. Get it through your\head.
[Kojiroh] Maybe I wouldn't have minded so much if\that waitress didn't bug me all the time.
[Kojiroh] You know, it wouldn't be bad if I could\wait on a hot chick once in a while.
[Kojiroh] He's late... And the bastard always nags\me about what time to meet.
[Waitress] Are you ready to order yet, or what?
b20
[Kojiroh] Me? Uhh... Could you just wait a little\while longer?
[Waitress] Figures...
[Kojiroh] My friend's just a tad late.
[Waitress] Jeez...
009
She goes off in a huff.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] That bitch... She must have a martini\shaker up her ass.
[Kojiroh] Damn, she pisses me off.
[Kojiroh] He's usually early... But it's almost\time.
[Kojiroh] There's 2 minutes left, to be accurate.
[Kojiroh] Glen's a nice guy, but he's so anal about\what time he arrives.
[Kojiroh] I'll sit down first.
[Kojiroh] Why not have a seat first?
[Kojiroh] My posture isn't good enough to stand and\wait for him. I'd feel self-conscious.
　Chair
　Counter
　Ceiling
[Kojiroh] I'm already seated.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, there's still some time left until\he gets here.
[Kojiroh] I'll take a seat and wait for him.
I sit down.
[Kojiroh] Hmm...
[Woman's voice] Can I take your order?
b20
[Kojiroh] ...
[Waitress] What'll it be.
[Kojiroh] My buddy will be here in a second. Wait\just a little more.
[Waitress] Jeez...
009
[Kojiroh] Hey! I haven't seen her before... Could\she be a new waitress?
[Kojiroh] Doesn't she know how to treat a customer.\The water overflowed a little.
I wipe the spill off the table.
[Kojiroh] Damn, I'm a customer. I pay them. Why am\I wiping the damn table.
[Kojiroh] It'd be alright if I was drinking alone,\but I have to talk to Glen about work.
[Kojiroh] It's better in these situations.
[Kojiroh] It's better to sit down in a chair...\Don't you think?
[Kojiroh] The counter...?
[Kojiroh] It'd be alright if I was drinking alone,\but I have to talk to Glen about work.
[Kojiroh] It's normal to sit at a table.
[Kojiroh] If I could sit on the ceiling, I'd be\able to see down all the girls' blouses.
[Kojiroh] Okay. I'll sit on the ceiling.
[Kojiroh] Whoa...!
[Kojiroh] Come on, I can do it...
[Kojiroh] Nope... No can do.
[Kojiroh] It would've been nice to see all those\tits, but there are only so many things a man can\do.

[Kojiroh] I love looking at all those bottles lined\up over there... Ah, the possibilities.
[Kojiroh] The bartender has to memorize where each\one is.
[Kojiroh] I just might be able to steal one for\myself.

[Kojiroh] I haven't met Glen yet.
[Kojiroh] Whoa, horsey! I just got here.
[Kojiroh] I didn't talk to Glen yet... Where do you\expect to go?
[Kojiroh] There's nothing to do in the lobby.
[Kojiroh] I'd be bored off my ass in the lobby.
[Kojiroh] I'm supposed to meet Glen here.
