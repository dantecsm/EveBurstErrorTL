[Purin] Ah!
[Kojiroh] Purin?!
[Purin] Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] I knew it was you. What are you dressed\up like that for?
[Purin] I thought it would be too dangerous to go\out at night looking like I usually do.
[Kojiroh] And what are you doing here?
[Purin] I got lost, that's all...
[Kojiroh] I was worried about you.
[Purin] You were?
[Kojiroh] Of course.
[Purin] I'm sorry... It won't happen again.
[Kojiroh] I thought maybe you'd gotten homesick.
[Purin] Oh, I'd never feel homesick.
[Kojiroh] Anyway, I'm glad you're all right. Do you\know how to get back to the office?
[Purin] Yes, I think so... You not coming with me?
[Kojiroh] I've got things to do. I'll be back in a\little while.
[Purin] Okay, see you then.

[Kojiroh] She said she was lost, but I doubt it.
[Kojiroh] She went pretty far off the main street\to be shopping.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Something doesn't make sense.
[Kojiroh] It just doesn't ring true.

[Kojiroh] Hey, you looked sexy at the pool.
[Yayoi] ...
[Kojiroh] Don't give me that look... What are you\doing here?
[Yayoi] I didn't solve the case... I'm here to\return the advance pay.
[Kojiroh] You're giving it back...???
[Yayoi] Of course. What did you expect?
[Kojiroh] Oh, give me a break.
[Yayoi] Shut up, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] You did try, you know? Although you\didn't find it, you did your job. You deserve to\get paid.
[Yayoi] Kojiroh, this is about trust between the\Katsuragi Offices and the client.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] You solved the case, so you get the money.\My offices failed. We don't get anything.
[Kojiroh] If that's the way world works, then a\whole bunch of offices would go bankrupt.
[Yayoi] This is my professional policy... No matter\what you say.
[Kojiroh] I understand that, but how will you pay\your employees?
[Yayoi] You don't need to worry about that. It's my\business.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Besides, there aren't any clients right\now. We have to start over fresh.
[Kojiroh] I see...
[Yayoi] Besides, Kojiroh...
[Kojiroh] Yeah?
[Yayoi] Have you seen Nikaido recently?
[Kojiroh] That S.O.B.?
[Yayoi] He's been acting strange lately.
[Kojiroh] Hasn't he always been that way?
[Yayoi] I'm being serious. Something tells me he's\investigating something on his own, without telling\me.
[Kojiroh] Fire the bastard.
[Yayoi] I can't. I need his expertise in my\company.
[Kojiroh] Fine. I'll tell him you're angry the next\I see him.
[Yayoi] Fine... I'll see you around.

[Kojiroh] It's Nikaido. How ya doin'?
[Nikaido] Use proper language when you speak to me,\you arrogant bastard.

[Nikaido] I'm here to meet Kou, but he's not\here...
[Kojiroh] Damn.
[Nikaido] I just wanted to tell him that I found a\vital clue.
[Kojiroh] What's that? You finally found your\prick?
[Nikaido] Your attitude leads me to believe that\you haven't found any clues at all.

[Nikaido] You fool... What are you here for? Tired\of masturbating?
[Kojiroh] I was actually here to ask you to give me\a hand with it, Ditto.
[Nikaido] It is Nikaido! Listen... You can take\your investigation and shove it. I've got the I.D.\investigation under control.

[Kojiroh] Why the hell is the map so complicated...\These turns are all wrong.
[Kojiroh] I should've had the address written down\and just taken a taxi. I could've met Travis\Bickle.
[Kojiroh] I bet Kou is a sloppy little bastard.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] But then, maybe he just moved and hasn't\had time to learn the area well.
[Kojiroh] Or maybe he has no sense of direction and\just hasn't a clue as to what the hell he writes on\a map.
[Kojiroh] Or maybe it was written by a private\secretary...
[Kojiroh] The whole damn thing just confuses me.
[Kojiroh] I hope he isn't a sloppy, unorganized\guy.
[Kojiroh] But hey, I'll be happy if he's just a\genuine client.

[Kojiroh] Hey, that house looks like it might be\his.

[Kojiroh] Good... I sank pretty deep into the earth\that time.
[Kojiroh] Excuse me, but what the hell is so fun\about stepping in the bushes??
[Kojiroh] I'm too tired to push that shit.
[Kojiroh] Okay, genius. If it makes you happy, I'll\push it.
[Kojiroh] There, happy?
[Kojiroh] Hey, will you just drop it already?

[Kojiroh] I'm in pain... I'd better stop this.
[Kojiroh] Well, I punched.
[Kojiroh] I lost... How about the light pole?
Smack.
[Kojiroh] Like this?
[Nikaido] What the hell are you doing, you\orangutan's scrotum?
[Kojiroh] Why the hell am I punching a light pole?\My bills are high, but this is no way to take out\anger.
[Kojiroh] Why not try something constructive?\...Like reconstructing Nikaido's face?
[Nikaido] What's so constructive about that?
[Kojiroh] No way. That might hurt too much.

[Nikaido] Sor...Sorry, Chief!
[Kojiroh] Does she have you whipped that bad?
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] Yayoi! When did you get here!
[Nikaido] Wha...what? Chief? Whe...where? Where?\Where? WHERE?
[Kojiroh] (This is more fun than playing computer\games alone at night!)
[Kojiroh] Hey, Yayoi.
[Nikaido] Wha? Chi...Chi...Chiefefef...
[Kojiroh] What are you doing? She's nowhere to be\found.
[Nikaido] ...
[Nikaido] Man, you scared the hell out of me.
[Kojiroh] That's because you're a big fat pussy.
[Nikaido] Just give me a break, okay Kojiroh?

[Nikaido] After this case is over...

[Nikaido] I'll be the Chief of this office. I'll\take Yayoi's place.
[Kojiroh] Is that so?
[Nikaido] Yeah, I'm gonna pound on you using this\case.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, try.
[Nikaido] Maybe then the boss will notice how\absolutely useless you are.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Nikaido] Then I'll have both "Chiefs", if you know\what I mean...
[Kojiroh] Are you really so stupid? I mean, really?
[Nikaido] Yeah. I really am that stupid.
[Kojiroh] Ah, to hell with it. You're pathetic.
[Nikaido] Giving up so soon?
[Kojiroh] I don't give a shit if you become the\next boss, and I don't care if you're dating Yayoi.
[Nikaido] And you shouldn't.
[Kojiroh] But just remember.
[Nikaido] What.
[Kojiroh] Don't you dare hurt her. She's very\sensitive.
[Nikaido] I don't think anyone could hurt her more\than you did, you hypocrite.
[Kojiroh] Call me names if you want. Just be sure\you don't hurt her.
[Nikaido] Mind your own business.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Nikaido] Hey you!
[Kojiroh] What?
[Nikaido] Dammit!!
[Kojiroh] Don't shit your pants over it.
[Nikaido] You questioned my reasoning in front of\Kou...
[Kojiroh] How could I resist, buddy?
[Nikaido] I'm not your buddy.
[Kojiroh] Okay. I'll just call you "Fido".
[Nikaido] It is Nikaido!! You'd better show some\respect, or I'll make you regret it!
[Kojiroh] It's not Shakespeare, but it's a cute\rhyme.
[Nikaido] You're walking on thin ice, pal. I'm\gonna bust your face.
[Kojiroh] I find it amusing, how anger brings out\all the cliches in the ignorant.
[Nikaido] Hey you!
[Kojiroh] What?
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] Keep talking.
[Nikaido] Keep away from Kou, you idiot. I'm gonna\solve this case.
[Kojiroh] That's very brave of you.
[Nikaido] Just make sure you keep away from the\boss, too.
[Kojiroh] I won't get near her.
[Nikaido] This case is a theft, and that's it. My\data says so.
[Kojiroh] Fine. Then keep investigating it as a\theft.

[Kojiroh] Look, you're right here.

[Kojiroh] Yeah, I kinda figured.

[Kojiroh] Actually, that doesn't seem too hard to\do...
[Nikaido] Have you seen a suit this chic before?
[Kojiroh] Yeah! Three suits for $24.99 back at the\Q-Mart.
[Nikaido] You idiot! This is an Armani, imported\from Hong Kong.
