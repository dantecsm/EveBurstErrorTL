[Purin] Why can't I be here?
[Policeman] You just can't, now go on home...
[Purin] Please, I just want to take a peek.
[Policeman] Go back to mommy...
[Purin] Don't treat me like a child! I'm not a\little girl!

[Kojiroh] Don't misunderstand. I just happened to\come by here, too.
[Girl] How can I trust a man holding a gun?
[Kojiroh] Gun? Oh, this is just a model gun...
[Girl] A model gun...?
[Kojiroh] Real versions of this gun are illegal...\Here, see?
[Girl] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] Don't look so scared.
[Girl] I don't exactly trust you yet...
[Kojiroh] Listen, why don't we stop this nonsense\and introduce ourselves?
[Girl] Introduce ourselves...?
[Kojiroh] Yeah. It's a revolutionary concept, but\it's usually a prerequisite to conversation.
[Girl] ...
[Kojiroh] I'm Kojiroh. Kojiroh Amagi. And you?

[Kojiroh] Listen... I'd like to stick around and\all, but if you--
[Girl] Kyoko. Kyoko Himuro...
[Kojiroh] That wasn't so hard, was it?
[Kyoko] I told you... I don't trust you yet.

[Kojiroh] The house is sealed off with police\tape...
[Kojiroh] They discovered that Kou was killed the\night before last...
[Policeman] What? What did you say...?
[Kojiroh] Nothing. I was just talking to myself.
[Kojiroh] The tape is blocking the bushes, so I\can't push them. Darn.
[Kojiroh] There's no need to push them, though.

[Kyoko] Well, I'll let you go. This time.
[Kojiroh] Don't worry, I won't run or hide. I'm too\broke for that.

[Kojiroh] You know, staring at people is a bad\habit.
[Kyoko] There's something different about you.

[Kyoko] I've never seen you and I hardly know\you... But I'm beginning to trust you.
[Kojiroh] Maybe I'm a likeable guy. I have that\effect on people.
[Kyoko] I can feel that you just won't run away\from this... Even if you are the murderer...
[Kojiroh] If I need to run away, I will. I'm not\one of those brave maniacs who dies for someone\else's reasons.
[Kyoko] But this time you're not running away.
[Kojiroh] There's no need to.
[Kyoko] ...Well I have to get going. We can't stand\here and talk all day.
[Kojiroh] You got that right...
[Kojiroh] Do you work for the government?
[Kyoko] What makes you say that?
[Kojiroh] Because I get the impression that you'd\go down with the ship, if you had to.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] Let's see... You've got plenty of logic,\a dangerous amount of courage, and a ridiculously\high level of pride.
[Kyoko] Are you assuming I'm a police officer?
[Kojiroh] I doubt it. But you're not part of any\non-governmental investigation... I think you're\somewhere in between...
[Kyoko] Pretty amazing... I've known you a few\minutes and I've already given you such an\impression.
[Kojiroh] I bet you I'm half right... I am, aren't\I?
[Kyoko] I can't give you the details, but you're\right. I do work for the government.
[Kojiroh] I knew it.
[Kyoko] But I'm the one who's perplexed... I have\no idea who you are.
[Kojiroh] I gave you my card, didn't I?
[Kyoko] Something tells me you're more than just a\private investigator.
[Kojiroh] I hate to disappoint you, but I'm afraid\I am. But I'm rarely given cases, and I'm almost\too broke to buy any food.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] What...
[Kyoko] I'll drop the criminal charges... How's\that?
[Kojiroh] That'll help.
[Kyoko] But I still don't completely trust you.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, yeah... Hey, contact me if you hear\anything.
[Kyoko] I'll use your business card.
[Kojiroh] As you wish.
[Kojiroh] (Whew...)
[Kojiroh] (At least we finally agree on\something...)
[Kyoko] I'll report it to the police.
[Kojiroh] Obviously, but...
[Kyoko] If you're innocent, you shouldn't have a\problem with it, right?
[Kojiroh] I'm innocent...as far as this case is\concerned.
[Kyoko] You sure look like a scoundrel...
[Kojiroh] I'm in enough trouble as it is... I\couldn't handle anymore.
[Kyoko] Now it's my turn to ask a question...
[Kojiroh] Shoot.
[Kyoko] What is your relation with Kou?
[Kojiroh] We're lovers... On weekends, mostly.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] And he was good... Damned good.
[Kyoko] Come on. Seriously.
[Kojiroh] He's a boring little pest, and he's my\client.
[Kyoko] Your client?
[Kojiroh] I'm a private investigator.
[Kyoko] A private investigator, eh?
[Kojiroh] Here, look at my card...
[Kyoko] "Amagi Private Detective Office, Chief..."
[Kojiroh] See? I'm the only one in the office.
[Kyoko] How do I know you're telling the truth?
[Kojiroh] You're a very skeptical gal.
[Kyoko] I just might be setting the murderer\free...
[Kojiroh] No you aren't. If that was the case,\you'd be the next victim.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] I'm not telling you not to inform the\cops. I didn't alter the crime scene, did I?
[Kyoko] I guess you're right...
[Kojiroh] I just rubbed the doorknob. Other than\that, everything's the same as before.
[Kyoko] So, you're cooperating with the police.
[Kojiroh] What, are you crazy? They leave me alone\and I leave them alone.
[Kyoko] I see...
[Kyoko] Keep talking.
[Kojiroh] I've got several reasons as to why you're\not the murderer.
[Kyoko] I'd love to hear each one of them.
[Kojiroh] First of all, you were shocked when you\entered the house and saw the body.
[Kyoko] I could have been acting...
[Kojiroh] Nice try, but you didn't know I was\hiding. There was no reason for you to act.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] And you knew it wasn't suicide.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] Furthermore, you were really scared of\me, weren't you?
[Kyoko] Maybe... Seeing a dead body in front of me\and then a man holding a gun behind me... It's not\something I run into everyday.
[Kojiroh] I should hope not.
[Kyoko] Anything else?
[Kojiroh] Hmm... You came into the house because\you thought there was something wrong.
[Kyoko] It's true...
[Kojiroh] I know... I think if you wanted to lie,\you'd come up with something better.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] And you accepted the fact that you might\die.
[Kyoko] Fine... You're pretty sharp.
[Kojiroh] Thanks.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] (Uh-oh... She looks as if she's about to\criticize me...)
[Kojiroh] (So she still doesn't trust me.)
[Kyoko] Why don't you think I'm the murderer?
[Kojiroh] You wanna hear my reasons?
[Kyoko] I'm just dying of anticipation.
[Kojiroh] Well, first of all, you've got a nice\ass.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] I'm only joking... Don't make that face.
[Kyoko] Do you mentally undress every woman you\meet?
[Kojiroh] Yes, but don't hold that against me.
[Kyoko] ...?
[Kojiroh] It's been long time since I've porked a\girl. My balls are bluer than the Pacific Ocean.
[Kyoko] ...
[Kojiroh] You should be honored to have the ass you\do. Some women pay top dollar for a caboose like\that.
[Kyoko] Excuse me?!
[Kojiroh] Don't wet your pants, I was only joking.
[Kyoko] Any more jokes out of you and I'll call the\police.
[Kojiroh] At least you find my conversation\interesting.
[Kyoko] This isn't exactly the stuff I'm used to\hearing during a murder case.
[Kojiroh] Hence, my lack of clientele.
