[Kou] Is there something I can do for you?

[Kojiroh] Nice room...
[Kojiroh] I thought it might be a little gaudier.

[Kojiroh] I said "fantastic." Your place is really\fantastic.
[Kou] Oh, why thank you. In any event I apologize\for keeping you waiting... I was with another\guest.
[Kojiroh] Don't sweat it. Let's cut the bullshit\and get down to business.
[Kou] Right you are. Allow me to introduce\myself...
[Kou] I am Kou, the owner of this house. It's a\pleasure to meet you.
[Kojiroh] Nice to meet you too. I'm the president\of Amagi Detective Offices...

[Kou] What sort of things?
[Kojiroh] Things about Sir so-and-so.
[Kou] Excuse me?
[Kojiroh] You know, the guy who painted your damn\painting.
[Kou] Oh, you mean Sir Lachal.
[Kojiroh] That's the guy.
[Kou] Is there something in particular about him?
[Kojiroh] I hear he's dead.
[Kou] Indeed he is. I believe it was about a\hundred years ago.
[Kojiroh] Do you know how he died?
[Kou] ...
[Kojiroh] He sliced his own neck.
[Kou] You certainly know a lot about him.
[Kojiroh] Incidentally, I'm also interested in the\legends surrounding that painting.
[Kou] Ahh, you learned of those as well.
[Kojiroh] Why didn't you give me that information\yourself?
[Kou] I didn't think that would help you find the\painting.
[Kojiroh] I'm the one who decides what's important\to know and what's not. Okay?
i[Kou] I stand corrected. Forgive me.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] What brings you here today?
[Kojiroh] Returning to the scene of the crime. It's\the basis of my investigation.
[Kou] I appreciate your favor.
[Kojiroh] You weren't here this morning.
[Kou] Yes, I went to school... Not for work, but to\meet with an acquaintance.
[Kojiroh] What a coincidence. I was there myself\today doing research in the library.
[Kou] What a shame we didn't see each other.
[Kojiroh] I found out some very interesting things\there.

[Kou] Indeed I do not. Since my wife passed on I've\been left completely alone.
[Kojiroh] That's too bad...
[Kojiroh] Kou, Kou, Kou... You're not really that\fat. You should go out and get laid sometime.
[Kou] I have feelings, sir. Please try not to hurt\them.
[Kojiroh] The master of this big, fat house...
[Kojiroh] A big, fat guy in control of a big, fat\house. You must have a lot of power.
[Kou] I'm just a dedicated but humble worker.
[Kojiroh] I'll bet you'd last a long time if\suddenly all food disappeared from the planet...
[Kojiroh] You've got a month's supply of ham\wrapped around your waist.
[Kojiroh] You've got thick muscles... I bet you\could bench press my Aunt Aretha (Or at least an\ant's urethra...).
[Kou] I've heard it all before, Mr. Amagi. That's\just a friendly way of calling me Chubby Peckers,\the rolly-polly fatass.
[Kojiroh] Hey, all I said was you've got big\muscles, don't get all defensive.

[Kojiroh] You'd better be.
[Kou] I'm counting on you, Mr. Amagi.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] That reminds me. I hear you're the\president of the international school.
[Kou] Who told you that?
[Kojiroh] No one in particular. I just came from\there...
[Kou] One of my female students told you?
[Kojiroh] You could say that, yes.
[Kou] They told you about the vacation?
[Kojiroh] Yes.
[Kou] Many people mistakenly assume that being a\Principal is an easy job. It's actually quite\exhausting.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] Consequently, I have saved up my vacation\hours and am taking the entire week off.
[Kojiroh] I didn't realize Principals made so much\money.
[Kou] Interesting observation, but I don't like\thinking about money very much.
[Kojiroh] (This guy's full of more hot air than a\blow-dryer.)
[Kojiroh] Would you rather I not go to your work\place?
[Kou] At the soonest I'll be back to work in three\days. It would be wonderful if you could find the\painting before that.
[Kojiroh] So what you're saying is that you're not\going back to work until I find the painting?
[Kou] I suppose it ends up being that way, yes.
[Kojiroh] I don't know what Nikaido's telling you,\but I'm well on my way to solving this thing.
[Kou] Is that so? What can you tell me now?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] I assure you I won't divulge any information\to Mr. Nikaido.
[Kojiroh] I'm not worried about that... It's\just... Aw, what the hell.
[Kou] I'm all ears.
[Kojiroh] This isn't the work of thieves.
[Kou] That's the exact opposite of what Nikaido\says.
[Kojiroh] Oh yeah?
[Kou] If thieves aren't behind this, who could it\be?
[Kojiroh] Good question. It could have just been\lost. But definitely not stolen.
[Kou] You sound quite sure of yourself.
[Kojiroh] My hunches are always right.
[Kou] This is only a hunch?
[Kojiroh] Yes. But what I call "a hunch" is a\combination of the deductive powers and experience\of the best detective this side of the Nile. It's\not a guess, if you catch my drift.
[Kou] I see...
[Kojiroh] Anyway, it may not be much right now, but\at least it's a hunch.
[Kojiroh] ...Of course, I have no idea where it is\yet.
[Kou] Is that so?...
[Kojiroh] Unfortunately.
[Kou] Mr. Nikaido, on the other hand, just informed\me that he has a good idea where to find it\already...
[Kojiroh] I could give a rat's ass what Nikaido\said. All I know is that I haven't found it yet.
[Kou] In other words, Mr. Nikaido is further along\in his investigation?
[Kojiroh] (Quit rubbing it in, you fat son of a\bitch!...)
[Kojiroh] I guess you could put it that way. But\after all, this business is about delivering\results.
[Kou] Quite so, Mr. Amagi, and results are what I\desire.

[Kou] That's all I could ever ask for...
[Kojiroh] Okay, then. See you later.

[Kojiroh] What is it?
[Kou] Tonight I have to meet with some people from\work.
[Kojiroh] Why are you telling me this?

[Kojiroh] Hey, crybaby, whether or not you give me\that sad look I've gotta be honest with you up\front. I still haven't found it.
[Kou] I'm not a crybaby...
[Kojiroh] I just had something I wanted to ask you.
[Kou] I asked a moment ago, and I will ask again.\What could it be?...
[Kojiroh] I forgot to ask you this last time, but\is this place wired with an alarm system?
[Kou] Yes it is. Why do you ask?
[Kojiroh] You know. I'm just trying to see this\thing from every possible angle.
[Kou] A true professional.
[Kojiroh] Are there any signs that the alarm system\went off?
[Kou] No signs at all... The thieves must have been\professionals as well.
[Kojiroh] (...)
[Kojiroh] (I can't make heads or tails of this\hot-dog.)
[Kou] I'm relieved to have a man who takes his work\as seriously as you do on my team.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] I trust, then, that it is safe to assume you\are close to finding the painting?
[Kojiroh] Don't make me laugh, butterball.
[Kou] Then what brings you here today? I'm sure it\wasn't simply to ask about my alarm system, was it?
[Kojiroh] Ummm... (Actually it was, smart-ass...)

[Kou] I mind a great deal.
[Kojiroh] No matter how much I look at it, this\place doesn't change. It's Cock's drawing room.\Period.
[Kojiroh] He probably doesn't want me to take any\of his nice shit home.

[Kojiroh] This is where that damn painting\disappeared from...
[Kojiroh] But there's still a lot of expensive\looking shit in here.

[Kojiroh] Hold the compliments until after I find\the painting.
[Kou] Sorry. By the way, I couldn't help but notice\the fact that Ms. Yayoi and Mr. Nikaido seem to\harbor a serious grudge against you.
[Kojiroh] Why don't you tell me something I don't\know?
[Kou] You didn't let me finish. I was going to say\that, even so, they hold your skill in very high\regard.
[Kojiroh] Now you're exaggerating.
[Kou] I believe someday you will all reconcile your\differences.
[Kojiroh] Who knows. Whatever happens, you can bet\that I'll be the one to find the painting.
[Kou] I hope you do, sir.
[Kojiroh] There is one thing I wanted to ask you.
[Kou] Go ahead.
[Kojiroh] The lady who brought me this case said\I'm just supposed to find the painting, not\actually bring it to you...
[Kou] That is correct. No matter what happens, even\if you find it in the middle of the street under a\dog's hind quarters...\[Kou] ...I simply want you to tell me where it is.
[Kojiroh] I suppose you wouldn't tell me why even\if I asked?
[Kou] I'm very sorry. Please understand. I hope\that the fee for solving the case is sufficient to\pay for whatever inconvenience this causes you.
[Kojiroh] If you say so. I guess that's all for\now.
[Kou] Thank you so very much...
[Kou] But that means...
[Kojiroh] Exactly. It means that there shouldn't be\so many minor mistakes. Something's fishy.
[Kou] I see...
[Kojiroh] And another thing... This room doesn't\look like it was ransacked at all.
[Kou] I feel I was very lucky.
[Kojiroh] Mr. Kou, you go ahead and feel however\you want to. I'm saying that something's not right\when a thief leaves so much behind.
[Kou] I suppose you have a point.
[Kojiroh] Why would they ignore all of these\priceless paintings, vases, the chandelier and your\antique desk?
[Kou] I have no idea.
[Kojiroh] Not to mention the path of the\footprints...
[Kou] Oh?
[Kojiroh] They lead right to the door in a straight\line.
[Kou] What's so strange about that?
[Kojiroh] I don't know how valuable that missing\painting is... But I've never heard of a thief\taking one thing and heading straight for the door.
[Kou] What have you concluded from all this, Mr.\Amagi?
[Kojiroh] I'm not sure yet.
[Kou] Oh?
[Kojiroh] I've just added this to my already long\list of things that don't line up. I don't have the\evidence I need to make any conclusions yet.
[Kou] I'm sorry to hear that...
[Kojiroh] Hey, I've got three days, don't I? I just\need a little more time to think to solve it.
[Kou] I only hope you're right...
[Kou] If you had to surmise a guess at this point,\what would you say?
[Kojiroh] Well, Nikaido disagrees with what I just\said. Right?
[Kou] Correct.
[Kojiroh] Well, I suppose Nikaido could be right,\but...
[Kou] But?
[Kojiroh] But there are too many problems with that\theory.
[Kou] For example?
[Kojiroh] For example... There's too many to count.\For example...
[Kou] Yes?
[Kojiroh] The dirt on the window frame. It\shouldn't be there.
[Kou] Isn't that evidence that it was a burglar?
[Kojiroh] No way. Why would he mess up something so\simple? He could have just taken off his shoes.
[Kou] ...
[Kojiroh] Besides, the lock on the window looks\completely untampered with.
[Kou] What would that suggest?
[Kojiroh] In other words...
[Kou] Yes?
[Kojiroh] A burglar would try to open the lock\using trial and error. Beating it with a board, or\wrapping wires around it.
[Kou] Is that how they do it?
[Kojiroh] Yes. But this lock doesn't show any signs\of such attempts.
[Kou] How odd.
[Kojiroh] Odd indeed. Even if it was a pro, they\might spend less time doing it, but still...
[Kou] ...
[Kojiroh] ...And there's another thing.
[Kou] Yes?
[Kojiroh] That window.
[Kou] Window?
[Kojiroh] Yeah, I was just checking it out... Look\at this.

[Kojiroh] There's dirt on the window sill, right?
[Kou] Yes.
[Kojiroh] I was wondering if you could tell me why.
[Kou] ...

[Kojiroh] You said you'd returned from your trip.
[Kou] That's right.
[Kojiroh] Since returning have you done any\cleaning or redecorating?
[Kou] No. It's exactly as I found it upon my\return.
[Kojiroh] I see. Then that pretty much settles it.
[Kou] Settles what?
[Kojiroh] It was probably a burglar. The evidence\all points to that, and I'm sure that's what the\police will decide, too.
[Kou] ...
[Kojiroh] What do you think of that?
[Kou] Impressive, Mr. Amagi.
[Kojiroh] Not really.
[Kou] In order to be fair, I was keeping a little\information from you...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] But I don't mind telling you now that\Katsuragi Detective Offices have come to the same\conclusion.
[Kojiroh] Really?

[Kou] My apologies...
[Kojiroh] It's Kou. I guess he left the other room\and came back here.
[Kojiroh] I just wish he wouldn't surprise me like\that...
[Kou] At your service.
[Kojiroh] Suddenly you appeared on the sofa...\How'd you get there?
[Kou] It was easy. I just jumped from over there.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, like you can jump!
[Kou] Just joking.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] The window... There was dirt on the\window...
[Kojiroh] There's no need to investigate anything\now. I should talk with Kou.

[Kojiroh] I wish I knew what was going on...
011
s10
[Kojiroh] This case bothers me...
[Kojiroh] I still think that fatass probably just\started some tax evasion scheme in a flurry to\balance his books...
[Kojiroh] On the other hand, what if all this\really is for the third anniversary of his wife's\death?
[Kojiroh] I don't really know what goes on in the\minds of rich people.
[Kojiroh] That Kou sure is slippery.
[Kojiroh] He's fat as Texas, too...
[Kojiroh] Whether it's tax evasion, or for the\memory of his wife, the important thing is that I\get my reward for finding it.
[Kojiroh] It's probably a good idea for me to stop\wasting my time and look for the damn thing.
011
[Kojiroh] In any event, I've got to find it before\Yayoi and Nympho.
[Kojiroh] But Yayoi's damn good...
[Kojiroh] I'd better get my ass moving.
[Kojiroh] It's a race against the clock. Forget\about the three days. I need to find it today or\tomorrow.
[Kojiroh] I'll check every goddamn nook and\cranny... And I might just check out a few grannies\for fun...
[Kojiroh] Yayoi said her investigation's going\well...
[Kojiroh] Of course I know she was lying. She\always closes her eyes and sucks on her cigarette\when she lies.
[Kojiroh] She's sweet like chocolate... That's her\secret charm...
[Kojiroh] It sounds stranger to come up empty\handed after a full day of investigating.
[Kojiroh] And Nikaido, while he ain't much of a\star, he ain't so stupid either. Yayoi knows he's\not that bad.
[Kojiroh] So the two of them have come across some\clues, but they still don't have any hard evidence.
[Kojiroh] Since I came after they did, I'm at an\overwhelming disadvantage.
[Kojiroh] I wonder what line of investigation\they're following...
　Surroundings
　Picture
　Cabinet
　Desk
　Paintings
　Window
[Kojiroh] I'll have another look.
s10
[Kojiroh] So this is the painting that's causing so\much fuss.
[Kojiroh] It might be in this room...
011
[Kojiroh] I'll have a look at the picture.
s10
[Kojiroh] So this is the painting.
[Kojiroh] It's my job to find this thing...
[Kojiroh] The line on the right isn't a sperm, it's\a match-stick.
[Kojiroh] Is it that obvious?
011
[Kojiroh] There's no use in looking vaguely around\the room.
[Kojiroh] I need to pay attention to the details.
[Kojiroh] Kou's in the next room. I'm alone now.
[Kojiroh] At least fatass is out of my hair for\now.
[Kojiroh] It's just me, myself, and I in here...
[Kojiroh] There's nothing in the cabinet.
[Kojiroh] Cabinets...
0005
[Kojiroh] I think this is where Kou was keeping\that picture.
[Kojiroh] There's nothing more to look for in the\desk.
[Kojiroh] It's an expensive looking antique...
[Kojiroh] I can't believe this skinny chair can\support fatass' fat ass.
[Kojiroh] It looks like it'd be crushed to\smithereens the moment he sits down.
[Kojiroh] Why not check out what's on top of the\desk?
[Kojiroh] On top of the desk there's a mountain of\books, a lamp, a pen holder, and a memo pad.
[Kojiroh] Inside the desk... Although I'm sure\Yayoi's already searched it.
I open the drawer.
I ruffle through the papers.
[Kojiroh] Nothing seems out of order.
[Kojiroh] Nothing particularly strange here. Just\your average painting.
[Kojiroh] I don't know who drew this stupid thing,\but it's a lousy painting.
[Kojiroh] Nothing strange... No hidden safe behind\it.
[Kojiroh] Just your average painting.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] But I don't understand art at all...
[Kojiroh] What's so great about hanging this shit\on the wall?
[Kojiroh] Come to think of it, Yayoi once told me\she wanted to leave me because I was an\"ignoramus," whatever that means.
[Kojiroh] Baby, please come back...
[Kojiroh] There's nothing special about this...
011b
[Kou] Find anything?
[Kojiroh] Holy balls!
[Kou] Have you collected your thoughts?
[Kojiroh] I guess so.
[Kou] Excellent.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] The dirt on the window sill and the\footprints leading straight to the door...
[Kojiroh] No matter how you look at it, it's gotta\be...
011e
[Kojiroh] There's dirt on the window frame...
[Kojiroh] This has gotta be...
There's noise.
[Kojiroh] That was the sound of my stomach\growling.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] If you look closely you can faintly see\footprints.
[Kojiroh] Evil walks among us... There are tiny\fallen fibers, too...
[Kojiroh] Leading in a straight line to that\door...
[Kojiroh] Interesting...
011
[Kojiroh] The window is exactly behind me.
[Kojiroh] I'll check it out...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Nothing seems out of order...
[Kojiroh] What's this?
011e
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] It's very faint, but there's some dirt on\the window sill...
[Kojiroh] Outside the window are... plants. This\dirt must have come from outside.
[Kojiroh] If I had to guess how this dirt got on\the window sill, I'd say...
[Kojiroh] Kou must have been playing a drinking\game here... Or maybe...
[Kojiroh] I got it! He was cleaning his shoes by\the window... No...
[Kojiroh] I know. Someone must have come in with\their shoes on.
[Kojiroh] Who that someone is... That's the\question.
[Kojiroh] Interesting...
011
　Go outside
[Kojiroh] I should stay here a little longer.
[Kojiroh] It's too early to go home.
[Kojiroh] I need to collect my thoughts...
　Look/Investigate
　Move
　Speak
　Kou
[Kou] Can I get you to look at this?
[Kojiroh] What is it?
s10
[Kou] This is the missing painting.
[Kojiroh] This picture?
[Kou] I made a color copy from an art book.
[Kojiroh] It's pretty small...
[Kou] The thing on the right is for size\comparison...
[Kojiroh] I see... It's a sperm. God, that's a\small painting.
[Kou] What?
[Kojiroh] How impressive. This thing's microscopic.\I'm always amazed at how fast micro-technology is\advancing...
[Kou] I don't want to disappoint you, Mr. Amagi,\but it's a matchstick.
[Kojiroh] (What?!) I knew that! Of course... I was\just kidding.
[Kou] You have a strange sense of humor.
[Kojiroh] I love telling jokes about semen.\Hah-ha-ha!
[Kou] ...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] It is a fairly small painting... About 5 cm\by 10 cm.
[Kojiroh] That makes 50 square centimeters.
[Kou] Is something significant about that?
[Kojiroh] No. I was just showing off.
[Kou] I see.
011
011b
[Kojiroh] Keep talking.
[Kou] Uh, yes. Anyway, this is the painting I'd\like you to find...
[Kojiroh] Wouldn't it be faster to just search this\room?
[Kou] Of course it would, if it were still here.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I know. I was just thinking that it would\be a shame if the thing was just hiding under one\of your million books...
[Kou] It's hard to see in the picture, but there's\a metal plate attached to the painting.
[Kojiroh] All right, but don't say I didn't try to\save you time. It's a pretty strange pattern.
[Kou] This is Islamic art...
[Kojiroh] Islamic art?
[Kou] That is correct. Islamic art consists of\geometrical patterns and mosques. The man who\painted this was...
[Kojiroh] Hey, Teach! Spare me the lesson in art\history. I'll worry about that later.
[Kou] As you wish.
[Kojiroh] So, Mr. Corn, where was the painting\before you and your friend or whoever went on\vacation?
[Kou] My acquaintance tells me that it was in a\cabinet drawer.
[Kojiroh] That thing in the back on the left...
[Kou] That's correct.
[Kojiroh] Interesting...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] Is something the matter?
[Kojiroh] Can I have a minute to think about this?
[Kou] Of course, of course... I shall leave you\alone to mull things over.
[Kojiroh] Thanks.
011
[Kojiroh] Well then...
eve_38
[Kojiroh] Do you have any enemies?
[Kou] I don't think so.
[Kojiroh] So you're telling me to search for this\thing?
[Kou] Yes please... Where are you going?
[Kojiroh] Sorry, but I'm gonna get the police to do\this.
[Kou] Are you aware of the workings of the police\system? Even if they know it's a crime...
[Kojiroh] But you can depend on them more than you\can a private eye like me.
[Kou] And let me say one more thing.
[Kojiroh] There's more?
[Kou] I have a social image to protect. I cannot\have too much gossip circulating about me.
[Kojiroh] That's a good point.
[Kou] You're not completely sure you want to take\the case?
[Kojiroh] You could say that.
[Kou] In that case, let me speak frankly of my true\motives.
[Kojiroh] (This should be interesting...)
[Kou] It's up to you whether to believe me or not.\But I need a top-notch investigator to find this\painting.
[Kojiroh] I thought you already got one of those.
[Kou] Of course I'm not saying that the Katsuragi\offices aren't top-notch. They just don't seem to\be as top-notch as you are.
[Kojiroh] (What the hell is this guy talking\about?)
[Kou] I'm willing to pay well. I'll even raise the\price 10% if you succeed.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] It seems to me like it would be a very good\case for you, Mr. Amagi.
[Kojiroh] (I don't do this job for the money... Aw,\hell, who am I foolin'?)
[Kou] You have some doubts. I just hope that the\fee will be enough to make you overlook them.
[Kojiroh] All right. I'll do you the favor. But\you'll have to raise the fee 20%.
[Kou] Agreed.
[Kojiroh] I'll look, but I can't promise you I'll\find it, you know.
[Kou] Thank you so very much.
[Kojiroh] It's too early to thank me. I haven't\even started looking yet.
[Kou] It may possibly have been a theft.
[Kojiroh] Possibly?
[Kou] Yes.
[Kojiroh] You mean you're not sure if it was\stolen?
[Kou] Just a few days ago, I was on vacation with\an acquaintance. I only just returned.
[Kojiroh] Was anyone here while you were away?
[Kou] Not that I know of.
[Kojiroh] So it must have been a burglary.
[Kou] The problem is that the painting in question\wasn't actually valuable.
[Kojiroh] So it was a piece of crap?!
[Kou] The value of all things depends upon who is\judging them, Mr. Amagi.
[Kojiroh] So you're saying that it's important to\you. But everyone else thinks it's crap.
[Kou] I couldn't have said it better myself.
[Kojiroh] So this is a case of betrayal.
[Kou] Betrayal?
[Kojiroh] I hate to put it like this, Mr. Kou.\Perhaps somone who doesn't want your fat ass to\mourn...?
[Kou] I suppose it's possible.
[Kojiroh] ...So you have no idea what happened to\this piece of crap and you want me to find it in\the next three days.
[Kou] That is correct.
[Kojiroh] Okay...
[Kojiroh] ...But can I ask you something?
[Kou] Go right ahead.
[Kojiroh] How the hell did you lose it?
[Kou] I'm not sure I follow you.
[Kojiroh] In other words, did you misplace it in a\move? Or did you lose it while remodeling the room?\Or...
[Kou] Or?
[Kojiroh] Was it a robbery?
[Kou] Honestly, I've been incredibly busy lately...
[Kojiroh] I wish I could say the same.
[Kou] As soon as I returned from my trip it was\time for the memorial service.\\[Kou] In the confusion I thought I should have an\acquaintance look after the important items for\the ceremony.
[Kojiroh] But, unlike dogs, people aren't always so\loyal.
[Kou] My acquaintance tells me that it was kept in\that cabinet.
[Kojiroh] Which cabinet?
[Kou] The one in back on the left... That one.
[Kojiroh] Which means that the painting might turn\up if we search this house.
[Kou] I suppose that it's conceivable.
[Kojiroh] Then what you need is a mover, not a\detective...
[Kou] Wait! Please!
[Kojiroh] What now?
[Kou] I haven't told you the main thing yet...
[Kojiroh] (I don't like the sound of this...)
[Kojiroh] Alright then. Tell me the specifics. And\no more bullshit, please.
[Kou] As you wish. You know about searching for the\missing painting?
[Kojiroh] Yeah.
[Kou] I need you to find this very important piece\of artwork. You have three days including today.
[Kojiroh] Three days!? That's crazy!
[Kou] That is the reason why I also contacted the\Katsuragi offices. I'm offering a very high reward.
[Kojiroh] Can you tell me why you need it within\the next three days?
[Kou] Of course. I was letting my acquaintance use\this study...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] And the artwork my acquaintance was\protecting is now missing.
[Kojiroh] Where's this jerk now?
[Kou] Overseas on business. He claims that he put\it in the cabinet. But when I looked...
[Kojiroh] It wasn't there.
[Kou] Correct. Nothing was there at all.
[Kojiroh] Is it expensive?
[Kou] I don't know about that.
[Kojiroh] What do you mean, you "don't know"?
[Kou] I was just telling Mr. Nikaido about this. I\need to use it for the third anniversary of my\wife's death.
[Kojiroh] You need this thing to mourn?
[Kou] You may think it strange, but it is a\ceremony necessary for consoling the spirit of the\deceased.
[Kojiroh] I see...
[Kou] If I have the painting there at the ceremony,\my wife, may Allah bless her soul, may find more\comfort in the afterworld.
[Kojiroh] I'm not gonna stand here and watch you\cry. See ya...
[Kou] Mr. Amichi!
[Kojiroh] The name's Amagi. I'm Japanese, not\Italian...
[Kou] Please, sir. For my poor wife...
[Kojiroh] Are you for real?
[Kou] 100%.
[Kojiroh] (This is the most pathetic person I've\seen since I shaved this morning...)
[Kou] I had no idea you were acquainted with Ms.\Katsuragi...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] I was just trying to find someone to take\this case. It doesn't matter who.
[Kojiroh] It's a free country. You're the client.\You can choose whoever you want to.
[Kou] I'm glad you feel that way.
[Kojiroh] In the end the one who should get the\money is the one who delivers the results.
[Kou] Thank you for understanding.
[Kojiroh] (Of course I can say that...)
[Kojiroh] (But the emotions involved are more\complicated...)
　Surroundings
　Kou
　Chandelier
[Kojiroh] (This place is pretty chic.)
[Kojiroh] (He's got a good mix of art and\nature...)
[Kojiroh] So this is your reception room. A whole\apartment could easily fit into this place.
[Kou] There are many other rooms in this house. I\just saw my last guest in the reception room over\there.
[Kojiroh] All alone in this huge place?
[Kou] That is correct.
[Kojiroh] How do you clean it?
[Kou] I have a maid and many other helpers to keep\the place up.
[Kojiroh] Wow...
[Kojiroh] (This place is like a palace.)
[Kojiroh] (Look at fatass over there on the\couch...)
[Kojiroh] You're a very big man... Must weigh 300\pounds or more.
[Kou] Actually I've been on a diet and I dropped to\293 pounds.
[Kojiroh] Are you trying to tell me there's a\noticeable difference between 293 and 300 pounds?
[Kou] There's a world of difference.
[Kojiroh] Like being in your 20's as opposed to\being in your 30's...
[Kojiroh] (The master of the house. "Kou.")
[Kojiroh] (He talks classy and acts real polite...)
[Kojiroh] (But I can't be fooled by the surface. I\have to pierce his fat exterior and see what he's\thinking.)
[Kojiroh] Your average, everyday, million-dollar\chandelier.
[Kojiroh] There's nothing really to look at.
[Kojiroh] An expensive chandelier...
[Kojiroh] I'd love to sit on that thing and use it\like a swing.
[Kou] Please refrain from doing so.
[Kojiroh] Shit...
　Go outside
[Kojiroh] Just relax and talk with Kou a little\more.
[Kou] Is there any particular reason you want to\climb onto my chandelier?
[Kojiroh] No reason at all. It has nothing to do\with anything. It just looks fun.
[Kou] I see...
[Kou] What on earth are you doing beneath the desk?
[Kojiroh] You never know what kind of clues you'll\find or where you'll find them. They could be tiny\or huge. Sometimes even as huge as you.
[Kou] You certainly know your trade.
[Kou] That's the bedroom, you know...
[Kojiroh] Understanding the layout of the house is\very important for an investigation.

[Kojiroh] Well lookie what we have here. A talking\vagina with a neck and shoulders.
[Nikaido] Don't be such a sicko! When will you stop\making fun of me?
[Kojiroh] Sorry. I'll never do it again.
[Nikaido] You'd better not!
[Kojiroh] (I should have known this idiot would've\been here...)
[Kojiroh] (It's not so bad.)
[Kojiroh] (Basically I have a one day handicap. I\should still be able to do it.)

[Yayoi] I could care less what you decide to do.\I'll doubt you'll be of much help if you take the\case, though.
[Kojiroh] You haven't changed a bit, baby.
[Yayoi] You're wrong. I've changed... I've had to.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Yayoi] Are you growing your hair?
[Kojiroh] I've been praying.
[Yayoi] For what?
[Kojiroh] Praying that I can reduce your pain since\you've been hanging around with this pile of shit.
[Nikaido] Is "this pile of shit" me?
[Kojiroh] Oh, you heard me?
[Nikaido] You said it right in front of me.\Pecker-breath!
[Yayoi] Cut it out, Nikaido. You'll provoke\Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] Hey!
[Nikaido] You're right, Ms. Katsuragi. We don't\have the time to waste on this idiot... Besides,\there was the call...

[Yayoi] Let's go, Nikaido.
[Nikaido] Yes, Ms. Katsuragi... Kojiroh's a jerk!\Look! He's giving me the bird!

[Yayoi] We haven't gotten anywhere with our\investigation yet, but we'll beat you to the finish\line.
[Kojiroh] I'm looking forward to it.
[Yayoi] The best man and woman will win, and you\will lose.
[Kojiroh] Don't try to be so tough.
[Yayoi] I just hope I don't have to see you again.
[Kojiroh] Is that right? (She's one cold mama.)
[Kojiroh] You on your period?
[Yayoi] You say it like it excites you.
[Kojiroh] You're just imagining things. So the two\of you are involved in this case?
[Yayoi] Yes, since a few days ago...
[Kojiroh] Have you come up with much?
[Yayoi] Nothing yet. That's why Nikaido and I\decided to search together.
[Nikaido] But, Ms. Katsuragi, my investigation's\going rather well...
[Yayoi] Keep your crap in your pants, honey. Wait\until you get results before you start bragging.
[Kojiroh] You let her treat you like that?
[Nikaido] It's none of your business!
[Yayoi] Cut it out, boys.
[Nikaido] I have nothing to say to you,\pecker-breath.
[Kojiroh] How rude...
[Kojiroh] That reminds me, Nikaido. You still doing\those I.D. investigations?
[Nikaido] Of course I am. Important Data\investigations are the best!
[Kojiroh] Wow.
[Nikaido] The most important thing in life is to\get the case solved.
[Kojiroh] That's right.
[Nikaido] What's with that look on your face?
[Kojiroh] Oh, nothing...
[Kojiroh] (This nerd's always inputting case\details into his electronic appointment book.)
[Kojiroh] (Isn't it a little early for that?)
[Nikaido] I have nothing to say to you.
[Kojiroh] As soon as your master calls, you get to\runnin'.
[Nikaido] You jerk!
[Yayoi] Stop it, Nikaido!
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] What you're saying is right, though.
[Nikaido] Of course I'm right. You can never tell\when a traitor will betray you. Mr. Kou, please\allow us to...
[Kojiroh] Hey, Nicrappo.
[Nikaido] It's "Nikaido"!
[Kojiroh] Let me tell you one thing.
[Nikaido] I'm all ears, big mouth.
[Kojiroh] Your nostril hairs seriously need to be\trimmed.
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] Don't shake your head like that. I'm\telling you, you've gotta shave your nose.
[Nikaido] Quit trying to make a fool out of me!
[Kojiroh] I'm not. I'm just having a little\friendly fun.
[Nikaido] You're no friend!

[Yayoi] Shut up about the way I talk.
[Kojiroh] Sorry.
[Kou] You mean you also know Ms. Katsuragi?
[Kou] You must have worked together with Katsuragi\Detective Offices.
[Kojiroh] That's right. You're pretty sharp,\Sherlock.
[Kou] You flatter me.
[Kojiroh] I know.
[Kou and Kojiroh together] Ah-hah-hah-hah-hah!
[Yayoi and Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] The slave shuts up pretty quickly when\his master's around.
[Nikaido] Are you calling me a slave?
[Yayoi] Shut up, Nikaido. Don't give him the\satisfaction.
[Nikaido] Yes, Ms. Katsuragi...
[Kojiroh] (But if Katsuragi Detective offices are\here, that means...)
[Kojiroh] (So this is what Akane meant when she\said she felt a little guilty.)
[Kojiroh] (That lying little bitch...)
[Nikaido] Mr. Kou, you're not planning on hiring\another detective, are you?
[Kou] As a matter of fact, I am. When I heard of\Mr. Amagi's talents I...
[Nikaido] Let me give you a piece of advice, Mr.\Kou.
[Kojiroh] Nobody wants to hear your advice.
[Nikaido] ...This man is certainly a professional.
[Kojiroh] That's true.
[Nikaido] A professional liar, a traitor and a\cheat!
[Kojiroh] My reputation as an honest, fair man\Speaks for itself.
[Nikaido] You? Honest and fair!?
[Kojiroh] At your service.
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] Can't you say anything to that?
[Nikaido] Do you see what I'm talking about, Mr.\Kou?
[Kojiroh] Don't ignore me.
[Nikaido] If you put the investigation in this\man's hands... The ceremony of the third\anniversary of your wife's passing will be ruined.\[Nikaido] Completely ruined.
[Kojiroh] You've got a big mouth, Nympho.
[Nikaido] It's Nikaido! Besides, Mr. Kou, this\man's license as a detective is suspended!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (I'm up against a crazed idiot who\doesn't know when to stop.)
[Kojiroh] Your point? Why the hell are you here?!
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] Play fair, idiot. I answered you.
[Nikaido] You said you were here to make fun of me!
[Kojiroh] At least it's an answer.
[Nikaido] No, it's not!
[Nikaido] Why did you come here, pecker-breath? Why\are you here? What's your purpose?
[Kojiroh] My answer to your first question is that\I came to make fun of you. My answer to your second\question is that I'm here to make fun of you.\[Kojiroh] My answer to your third question is that\I intend to make fun of you.
[Nikaido] Why, I oughtta...
[Kojiroh] You oughtta shut up.
[Nikaido] Get outta my face!
[Kojiroh] How long has it been since we last saw\each other? Three months?
[Nikaido] About that.
[Kojiroh] I used to work with you as your superior.\Don't you think you're being a little cold?
[Nikaido] You used to be a lot of things. Now\you're nothing.
[Kojiroh] You may have a point...
[Kou] Do you mean to say that you used to work for\the same agency?
[Nikaido] Unfortunately, yes.
[Kou] Well I'll be damned... It's a small world!
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] (I'm starting to like this guy Kou.)
[Kou] It really is a small world.
[Kojiroh] Tell me about it. I'm still a little\surprised.
[Kou] I had no idea that you knew each other.
[Kojiroh] Neither did I.
[Kou] It's so...
[Kojiroh] ...Unexpected.
[Kou and Kojiroh] Ah-hah-hah-hah-hah...
[Nikaido] What are you laughing at?!
　Surroundings
　Nikaido
　Kou
　Yayoi
　Cigarette
[Kojiroh] You look sexy sucking on that\cancer-stick.
[Kojiroh] Suck harder baby!...
[Yayoi] Shut up.
[Kojiroh] Whatever you say.
[Kojiroh] You still smoke like a chimney.
[Yayoi] Life's too short not to.
[Kojiroh] I see you still only smoke Vagina Slims.\I bet your teeth are pretty stained.
[Yayoi] Since when did you become a dentist?
[Kojiroh] I didn't. I can see the stains with my\own eyes every time you open your mouth.
[Yayoi] I'd rather marry a shit-fly than have you\looking into my mouth.
[Kojiroh] I'd like to see you married to a\shit-fly.
[Yayoi] Why are you so stupid?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (He is so fat that I can still see him\even when he is behind Yayoi.)
[Kojiroh] (I thought Nikaido had left, only to find\out he's hiding behind Yayoi.)
[Kojiroh] (Bastard. He gets to look at the back of\her perfect neck.)
[Yayoi] I feel something itching at my waist...
[Kojiroh] (There's no need to look at Kou now...)
[Kojiroh] (I can't see too well 'cuz Nikaido's in\the way...)
[Nikaido] Don't push me! What do you think you're\doing?
[Kojiroh] I just wanted to get a look at Kou...
[Kou] You needn't be so thoughtful.
[Kojiroh] But I must.
[Kou] No you mustn't.
[Kou and Kojiroh] Ahh-hah-hah-hah-hah...!
[Kojiroh] The president of Katsuragi Detective\Agency. She's one scary lady.
[Kojiroh] The female detective in charge of\Katsuragi Detective Agency.
[Kojiroh] We used to be colleagues...
[Yayoi] But you had to go and screw it all up.
[Kojiroh] Do you have to keep reminding me?
[Kojiroh] Suddenly this room is full of people...
[Kojiroh] One, two, three... four of us including\me.
[Kou] I am, however, as big as two people. So\perhaps we should say that there are five of us.
[Kojiroh] We couldn't.
[Kou] Oh, but we could.
[Kou and Kojiroh] Ahh-hah-hah-hah-hah...!
[Yayoi and Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] Before me I see a noisy oddball.
[Nikaido] I won't stoop to your level, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] This is supposed to be Mr. Kou's\reception room...
[Kojiroh] But all I see in front of me is an\impotent freak.
[Nikaido] Don't call me that!
[Kojiroh] If you say so, Necrophilio.
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] You like having sex with dead animals,\Necrophilio?
[Nikaido] My name is Nikaido. I am a proud agent at\the Katsuragi Detective Agency.
[Kojiroh] Aw, what the hell... I'll give you a\break.
[Kojiroh] Your name is Nikaido, and you like having\anal sex with dead animals.
[Nikaido] No I don't!
[Kojiroh] But I could have sworn I saw you on that\"Feces of Death" video.
[Kou] Is that so, Mr. Nikaido?
[Nikaido] Mr. Kou, please don't encourage him. I'm\a...
[Kojiroh] Slave who plays fetch with Red Rover\after he's been run over.
[Nikaido] No! I'm the second highest agent in the\Katsuragi agency...
[Kojiroh] And his name is Necrophilio.
[Nikaido] Nikaido! It's Nikaido!!
[Kojiroh] You're out of breath. Is it asthma?
[Nikaido] ...
　Go outside
[Kojiroh] I'll stay here a little bit longer.
[Kojiroh] That'll probably be more interesting.
[Nikaido] What the hell do you think you're doing\in the window?
[Kojiroh] I was going to go out, but it looks like\there're plants outside.
[Nikaido] If you're leaving, use the door. And\hurry up.
[Kojiroh] Then I think I'll stay.
[Nikaido] ...
