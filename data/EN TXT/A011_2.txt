[Kojiroh] I've come this far, I can't just go back\disappointed.
[Kojiroh] I might as well do what I came to do.
[Kojiroh] This place is empty... What am I, a\thief?
I go in.
[Kojiroh] I'm coming in, Kou.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] There's no response.
[Kojiroh] But it sure is dark in here... There's\not a single light on in there.
[Kojiroh] What was Nikaido doing here...?
The floor squeaks as I walk.
[Kojiroh] I can hear the floor creaking.
[Kojiroh] Let's go to the reception room.
My feet touches something.
[Kojiroh] Oh, here are some slippers.
[Kojiroh] I'm feeling my way through this, so I'd\better pay close attention.
I open the door.
[Kojiroh] This should be the reception room.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Kou? Are you here?
... 
[Kojiroh] The least he could do is tell me he ain't\here.
...
[Kojiroh] It's so dark I can't see a damned thing.
[Kojiroh] My eyes are getting used to the dark.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] No one seems to be here.
[Kojiroh] Hey!
...
[Kojiroh] No one's here...
[Kojiroh] Well, hanging around here like this isn't\solving any problems.
[Kojiroh] Let's go... Wow!
I slip on the floor and fall on my ass.
[Kojiroh] Ouch! The damn floor!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] This is damp, whatever it is... Like\salad dressing.
[Kojiroh] No, that's not it. It's more like...
[Kojiroh] Oh...My...God... It can't be...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] I'd...I'd better just stand up.
[Kojiroh] Who touched me! Who the hell was it!

[Kojiroh] There's a dead body...
[Kojiroh] Calm down, calm down... This isn't\necessarily a dead body.
The body is lifeless.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] He's dead... He's REALLY dead!
[Kojiroh] ...I better stay calm. Got to stay\calm...
[Kojiroh] I can't panic.
[Kojiroh] Oh, mommy mommy mommy...
[Kojiroh] I gotta calm the hell down... Okay, I'm\calm.

[Kojiroh] BAM!
[Girl] Ah!
[Kojiroh] Just kidding...
[Girl] I'll do whatever you say... Just don't shoot\me!
[Kojiroh] (Let's stop this.)
[Kojiroh] BAM!!
[Girl] Yikes!
[Kojiroh] If you move an inch I'll blast your\intestines into your nostrils.
[Girl] Okay...
[Kojiroh] (Hey, she's trembling...)
[Kojiroh] (I'm a sinner...)
　Girl
[Kojiroh] No point in asking questions here.
[Girl] ....!?!
[Kojiroh] Stay like that and face the door.
[Girl] What are you gonna do to me? I'll beat your\ass if you try something funny.
[Kojiroh] Idiot! I told you to go outside!
[Girl] ...
[Kojiroh] Do it now!!
[Girl] I'd like to pull up my pants, if you don't\mind.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Girl] I'm too embarrassed like this... I'd rather\die.
[Kojiroh] Fine. Pull up your stupid pants.
[Girl] Thanks.

[Kojiroh] Now, let's go outside... And don't turn\around.
[Girl] Anything you say.
[Kojiroh] Did you touch anything besides the\doorknob?
[Girl] ...?
[Kojiroh] God dammit!! I asked you a question!!
[Girl] No... I didn't.
[Kojiroh] Good. Now, go outside.
[Girl] ...
[Kojiroh] Slowly! And don't try anything funny!
[Kojiroh] (Whew...)
[Kojiroh] (At least we're finally outside...)
[Kojiroh] (Things are getting crazier by the\minute...)

[Kojiroh] What the hell did you come to see Kou\about?
[Girl] I can't tell you...
[Kojiroh] Spit it out!
[Girl] ...
[Kojiroh] I might be the murderer, and I just might\kill you too!
[Girl] If you're gonna kill me anyway, then I'm not\talking.
[Kojiroh] Use your head! I'm only human, and I'm\capable of doing some crazy shit.
[Girl] Maybe.
[Kojiroh] (What a bitch.)
[Kojiroh] Shut up and listen to my next question.
[Girl] ...
[Kojiroh] How are you involved with Kou?
[Girl] I'm a student and he's the Principal.
[Kojiroh] You must be joking.
[Girl] No joke. I have a student ID, and my\schedule of classes.
[Kojiroh] That's not the answer I was expecting.
[Girl] Did you want to hear that I was his lover?\That I give him head?
[Kojiroh] Uh... That would've been nice, yes. But I\believe you. You're smart and you have good tits.
[Girl] That's what I hate about myself. If I'm to\die in my line of work, I'd rather not do it\looking like this.
[Kojiroh] Die...? Line of work...?
[Kojiroh] (The situation has taken a strange turn.)
[Kojiroh] (And we can't just stay here forever...)
[Kojiroh] (It's just about time...)
[Kojiroh] Let's get to the point. What are you\doing here?
[Girl] ...
[Kojiroh] Hey! I'm a man, you know... Looking at\that cute ass of yours gives me some crazy ideas!
[Girl] I had to do something for the owner of this\house.
[Kojiroh] Kou?
[Girl] Yes.
[Kojiroh] So why did you come inside?
[Girl] Because... Well...
[Kojiroh] Spit it out, dammit!!
[Girl] I pressed the doorbell on the intercom, but\it didn't ring. I thought it was broken, so I\knocked on the door. And it was open, so...
[Kojiroh] (Hey, the same thing happened to me!)
[Girl] What are you going to do with me?
[Kojiroh] I ask the questions here!
[Girl] ...
[Kojiroh] You don't really look like a typical high\school student.
[Girl] What's the definition of a typical high\school student?
[Kojiroh] Well, maybe you're right... I'll ask a\different question.
[Girl] ...
[Girl] I didn't do anything! I'm just a girl in\high school! Does that bother you? Can I turn\around now?
[Kojiroh] Shut up! Do high school girls go around\to other people's homes to search dead bodies!?!
[Girl] That's just a coincidence! What's so strange\about what I did? Huh?
[Kojiroh] You must be more than just a schoolgirl!\Act cool before I do something illegal!
[Girl] ...
[Kojiroh] That's better.
[Girl] What are you going to do with me?
[Kojiroh] First, I'll have you take off those nice\pants.
[Girl] ...!?!
[Kojiroh] Don't move... My fingers are twitching on\the trigger.
[Girl] What will you do after I take them off?
[Kojiroh] I'll let you know when we get to that\point.
[Girl] ...
[Kojiroh] Hurry up, before I shoot my load!
[Girl] Okay, okay! No need to be so violent.
[Kojiroh] Hey, you don't need to take it all off.\Just pull them down to your knees.
[Girl] ...?
0160b
[Girl] ...Like this?
[Kojiroh] Yeah. I like that.
[Girl] Now what are you going to do...?
[Kojiroh] I don't like fooling around with passive\girls.
[Girl] ...
[Kojiroh] So you can relax.
[Girl] Thanks a lot.
[Kojiroh] Well, at least you can still speak.
[Girl] Let me get this straight... You won't hurt a\passive girl, but you'll murder someone with a\knife?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Girl] Did you really kill him...?
[Kojiroh] Why do you suspect this is a murder?
[Girl] Well...
[Kojiroh] Answer me!!
[Girl] I've never known anyone to commit suicide by\slitting their own throat.
[Kojiroh] I see.
[Girl] ...Were you after something?
[Kojiroh] I'll do the asking around here.
[Girl] ...
[Kojiroh] Spread your hands out to the sides.
[Girl] Like this?
[Kojiroh] Yeah. Just like that...

[Kojiroh] (She's not wearing a school uniform, but\an athletic outfit.)
[Kojiroh] (She's definitely the student from that\international school.)
[Kojiroh] (What the hell is she doing here...?)
[Kojiroh] (She's got such long hair...)
[Kojiroh] (It flows all the way down to her waist.)
[Kojiroh] (I'd love to see that hair draped across\a pillow...)
[Kojiroh] (Is this any time to be admiring her\ass?)
[Kojiroh] (I'd better talk to her for a little\while longer.)

[Kojiroh] I can hear someone walking down the\hallway in shoes... Is that Kou?
[Kojiroh] Kou always wears slippers.
[Kojiroh] Which means... No way...
The door opens...
[Kojiroh] (Someone's entering the room...)
[Kojiroh] (They're holding a flashlight...)
[Kojiroh] (The person would turn on the lights if\they lived here.)
[Kojiroh] (Which means... It's an uninvited guest.)

[Kojiroh] (Yeah, I can't just stand here and\watch...)
[Kojiroh] Don't move.

[Kojiroh] Stay still... Don't turn around! Don't\even move your little finger...
[Girl] Okay! I'll do whatever you say.
[Kojiroh] (Shit... Now what do I do?)
[Kojiroh] There's nowhere to hide in this room...
[Kojiroh] There's a curtain that reaches the\floor... I can hide behind that.
[Kojiroh] Maybe I can be a human chair or\something.
[Kojiroh] I'll be lucky if she sits on my lap.
[Kojiroh] ...Just kidding.
　Man's body
　Jacket
　Wound
[Kojiroh] This ain't the time to be touchy-feely...\Someone's coming.
[Kojiroh] The body is starting to stiffen...
[Kojiroh] But it's still warm... He wasn't killed\so long ago.
[Kojiroh] The body's still warm... He was killed\just a while ago.
[Kojiroh] This ain't the time to be touchy-feely...\Someone's coming.
[Kojiroh] The jacket is soaked with blood.
[Kojiroh] There are spots all over, some of them already dry.
[Kojiroh] The flesh near the wound is a little\warm.
[Kojiroh] This ain't the time to be touchy-feely...\Someone's might coming.
[Kojiroh] It's still slightly warm.
[Kojiroh] It'll start drying pretty soon... The\blood has stopped flowing.
[Kojiroh] The skin is beginning to harden...
　Man
[Kojiroh] This isn't the time to hang around and\shoot the shit, man!
[Kojiroh] This guy is 100% dead... He's not gonna\talk to me... Idiot...
[Kojiroh] He's dead.
[Kojiroh] I guess this means he won't be talking to\me.
　Surroundings
　Man
　Wound
　Jacket
　Knife
[Kojiroh] This ain't the time to stare at it. There\are certain web sites for that.
[Kojiroh] And the knife lying behind the sofa\bothers me...
[Kojiroh] If he cut his own throat, the knife\would've fallen at his feet.
[Kojiroh] It could be that he just threw the knife\away in pain and agony.
[Kojiroh] But the physics don't make sense... Why\would it be behind the sofa.
[Kojiroh] This is some weird shit.
The door opens...
[Kojiroh] What the...?
It slams shut...
[Kojiroh] Holy shit! Someone just shut the front\door!
I hear foot steps.
[Kojiroh] Someone's coming!
[Kojiroh] I'm screwed if anyone catches me like\this...
[Kojiroh] But even if it was a suicide... There're\a few strange things about it.
[Kojiroh] People who commit suicide usually use the\most painless methods.
[Kojiroh] Having your neck slashed is one of the\most painful ways to die...
[Kojiroh] But it doesn't necessarily make sense as\a murder, either.
[Kojiroh] Killers don't usually leave their weapons\at the crime scene.
[Kojiroh] So it's suicide then?
[Kojiroh] I can't touch it! I'd leave a\fingerprint...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] But that's one big-ass knife... Looks\like a survival knife.
[Kojiroh] This must've been the murder weapon.
[Kojiroh] Hey! How long do I have to look at this\mess?
[Kojiroh] The bloodstained knife is right behind\the sofa...
[Kojiroh] I'll check it out.
[Kojiroh] There's something on the floor, behind\the sofa.
[Kojiroh] My eyes must've gotten used to the dark.
s03
[Kojiroh] It's a knife.
[Kojiroh] It's a survival knife.
[Kojiroh] Could this be the murder weapon?
[Kojiroh] This doesn't look like a suicide...
[Kojiroh] But I can't say that it was a murder for\sure.
[Kojiroh] Where the hell is Kou? I wonder if he\knows this body is lying in his house.
[Kojiroh] The entire room smells like iron from\blood...
[Kojiroh] I might have fainted if I'd have come\here during the daylight.
[Kojiroh] The floor is covered with blood... I can\hear the sticky squishy sounds with each step I\take.
[Kojiroh] Great. I've ruined my socks...
[Kojiroh] I think I checked everything out.
[Kojiroh] I'd better look over everything more\thoroughly.
[Kojiroh] But who the hell is this guy?
[Kojiroh] It's too dark for me to see anything\clearly...
[Kojiroh] There must be a sea of blood.
[Kojiroh] But I'm glad it's dark... I might have\fainted if I saw the body close and personal.
[Kojiroh] This place must be a sea of blood.
[Kojiroh] It's too dark for me to see the\details...
[Kojiroh] The man is sitting on the sofa, dead...
[Kojiroh] Hey! How long do I have to look at this\mess?
[Kojiroh] His eyes are enough proof for me... This\is one dead sucker.
[Kojiroh] He must've been a handsome guy when he\was alive.
[Kojiroh] His eyes are dazed; he's off in a world\of death.
[Kojiroh] He can't close his eyes, rigor mortis has\begun...
[Kojiroh] He looks like he's in his mid-thirties.
[Kojiroh] He looks like an ordinary fella.
[Kojiroh] He's dead...
[Kojiroh] Gee, he'd look like a zombie if he got up\and went to the fridge.
[Kojiroh] There's a dead stranger in Kou's house.
[Kojiroh] What the hell's going on around here...
[Kojiroh] I've never seen this guy before...
[Kojiroh] Who the hell could he be?
[Kojiroh] He's not Kou...
[Kojiroh] He's wearing glasses and he's slim...
[Kojiroh] No diet in the world could make Kou look\like this.
[Kojiroh] Hey! How long do I have to look at this\mess?
[Kojiroh] I've already looked at it more than\enough.
[Kojiroh] It's making me sick to my stomach.
[Kojiroh] His neck looks like a small scale model\of the Grand Canyon.
[Kojiroh] This is bad...
[Kojiroh] He could've bled to death...
[Kojiroh] Or maybe he choked to death on his own\blood...
[Kojiroh] Either way, it's a shitty way to die.
[Kojiroh] I think the bleeding has stopped... His\wound is starting to dry.
[Kojiroh] But it's still a little warm inside his\body.
[Kojiroh] And that means that he wasn't killed too\long ago.
[Kojiroh] He might've been killed this evening, or\maybe it was later...
[Kojiroh] His neck was slashed like a Halloween\pumpkin.
[Kojiroh] It must've been cut with an incredibly\sharp knife.
[Kojiroh] Like the one used in my circumcision.
[Kojiroh] It was definitely cut with a deadly,\sharp blade.
[Kojiroh] Maybe a sword?
[Kojiroh] Nah...
[Kojiroh] There's a horrible wound in the neck\area.
[Kojiroh] Argh! The neck is sliced like a summer\squash!
[Kojiroh] This is some bad shit!
[Kojiroh] Hey! How long do I have to look at this\mess?
[Kojiroh] There's nothing in the jacket.
[Kojiroh] Nope... Nothing here.
[Kojiroh] I'd learn a lot more if I saw his\license.
[Kojiroh] I mean, it's not like I'm doing anything\sacrilegious.
[Kojiroh] I'll check his jacket.
[Kojiroh] Wow... It's stiff from the dried blood.
I shuffle through his jacket.
[Kojiroh] Nothing's here.
[Kojiroh] It's smothered in blood... He bled all\over this thing like a mad girl's tampon.
[Kojiroh] It's so full of blood I can't tell what\color it was originally.
[Kojiroh] It's begun to dry... The clothing is\becoming rice crispy treats.
　Go outside
[Kojiroh] I can't just go outside now...
[Kojiroh] I have to hide somewhere.
[Kojiroh] I'd better check out the area some more.
[Kojiroh] Not yet... I wanna check this place out\some more.

0005
[Kojiroh] (Oh yeah... I remember it was this one.)

[Kojiroh] (It's in the bottom middle drawer...)
[Kojiroh] (But the lower right one had two levels.)

[Kojiroh] (That's right! It had two levels to it!)
[Kojiroh] (Why wasn't it in the lower right...?)
[Kojiroh] (If there's a clue left...)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Nothing in the drawer... And one drawer\with a shallow bottom. Search more?)
[Kojiroh] (Hold on a second... One shallow drawer?)
[Kojiroh] (Just one?)
[Kojiroh] (The drawers are all the same. But one\shallow drawer.)
[Kojiroh] Let's see...
[Kojiroh] I got it!!

b06
[Nikaido] You got what.
[Kojiroh] Hold the lower middle drawer, Nikaido.
[Nikaido] The lower middle?
[Kojiroh] The one with the notepad inside.
[Nikaido] ...

[Kojiroh] (Unless my reasoning is completely...)
[Kojiroh] (But I can't think of any other\possibility.)
[Nikaido] I'm holding it.

011f
[Kojiroh] Is this the lower middle drawer?
[Nikaido] Yeah...
[Kojiroh] Peel the bottom off.
[Nikaido] Why...?
[Kojiroh] There are two levels.
[Nikaido] There are!?!
He shakes the drawer.
[Nikaido] You're right! There's something inside\it!
He shakes it again.

Nikaido opens the drawer.
[Kou] Ah...!!
[Nikaido] What the hell is this!?!
[Kou] It's the painting!!
[Kojiroh] ...Thought so.
[Kou] I can't believe it!
[Kojiroh] Neither can I.
[Nikaido] But... Why, Kojiroh?
[Kojiroh] You want an explanation?
[Nikaido] Of course!!
[Kojiroh] (The memo in the drawer.)
[Kojiroh] ("Search even further!")
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (Why the hell was that written there...?)
[Kojiroh] (To leave a clue about the painting's\whereabouts?)
[Kojiroh] (But the painting wasn't there...)
[Kojiroh] (Why would anyone go through all that?)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Nikaido] What's the matter, Kojiroh? You're\awfully quiet.
[Kojiroh] (Wait a minute...)
[Kojiroh] (I'm not completely wrong... I was right\about the drawer's two levels.
[Kojiroh] (And the note...the sight of\buglary....the drawers with nothing in there...)
[Kojiroh] (Dammit! Even though all these pieces\point to my logic!)
[Kojiroh] (But the painting still isn't here.)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kou] You must remain calm, Kojiroh...
eve_13
[Kojiroh] (Was all my reasoning wrong...?)
[Kojiroh] (And I was so sure of myself.)
[Kojiroh] (But there really wasn't anything in that\lower level...)
[Kojiroh] (I guess I was badly mistaken... It\happens.)
[Kojiroh] ...
[Nikaido] What happened to all your arrogance?
　Kou
　Nikaido
[Kou] Thank you so much...
[Kojiroh] I solved the case. Looks like it's all\over, folks. May I collect my reward now?
[Kou] Of course! Do you accept cash?
[Kojiroh] Cash? Sure I do!!
[Kou] It's already prepared.
He hands me the money.
[Kojiroh] This is the thickness I like!
[Kou] Go ahead. Make sure it's the right amount. I\even paid a little extra.
[Kojiroh] I can tell by the wad... It's the right\amount.
[Kou] You're very professional.
[Kojiroh] Yeah, and you're skinny. By the way, Kou.
[Kou] Yes?
[Kojiroh] Your friend is pretty tricky, isn't he?
[Kou] He could give you a better answer than I.
[Kojiroh] Why did he go through all the trouble?
[Kou] I believe I've paid you an amount high enough\to shut you up for the time being.
[Kojiroh] ...Yes, you did.
[Kou] And once again, I thank you so much for all\your work.
[Kojiroh] (...Too bad he only hired me for this.\I'd be a rich man if I gave him sexual favors!)
[Kojiroh] (It's not my business what kind of\friends he got.)
[Kojiroh] (I'll just have to settle with that.)
[Kou] I just can't thank you enough!!
[Kou] Thank you so much, Mr. Amagi!!
[Kou] My deceased wife may finally rest in peace...
[Kojiroh] (I wonder how much it would cost to shut\YOU up.)
[Kou] I expected this...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Then let me continue.
[Kou] Go right ahead.
[Kojiroh] There's too much evidence making it look\a theft. And there's a lot of publicity saying it\was a theft.
[Kou] You're right. The burglar was just trying to\leave his sign.
[Kojiroh] Wrong... Usually, thieves don't leave\behind any evidence.
[Kou] And?
[Kojiroh] Basically, the owners of the house\wouldn't even know there was a theft.
[Kou] I see...
[Kojiroh] First I thought it was a work of a pro...\But there was something... Not right.
[Kou] That's what I was told before.
[Kojiroh] So I looked at the note again.
[Kou] Note?
[Kojiroh] The one I just showed you.
[Kou] Oh, the one that read, "Search even\further!"... Right?
[Kojiroh] Yeah. Maybe this is a coincidence, but\the note didn't fit when I tried to close the\drawer.
[Kou] Well...?
[Kojiroh] Think about it. Pay attention to the\drawers.
0005
0005j
[Kojiroh] There's a pen clogged in the lower right\drawer.
[Kojiroh] I'm gonna put the note back into the\lower middle drawer.
0005
I slide the drawer.
[Kou] Whoa, it went in!
[Nikaido] So what?
[Kojiroh] I put the drawer back in exactly the same\way.
[Kou] What are you getting at?
[Kojiroh] I think all other drawer will fit too.
[Kojiroh] Let's try it. First the top left.
0005b
I slide the drawer.
0005
[Kojiroh] It went in. The pen doesn't get hitched.
[Kojiroh] How about the upper middle one?
0005c
I slide the drawer.
0005
[Kojiroh] This one is okay too.
[Kojiroh] And next is the upper right.
0005d
I slide the drawer.
0005
[Kojiroh] This one's alright. The notepad is in the\drawer.
[Kojiroh] Now, for the lower left drawer.
0005e
I slide the drawer.
0005
[Kojiroh] It's in there. Now let's check the first\drawer I put the notepad into.
0005f
I slide the drawer.
0005
[Kojiroh] And obviously, it's there. But if we\check the lower right one?
0005g
I slide the drawer.
0005
0005j
The drawer doesn't go in all the way.
[Kojiroh] See, the pen gets hitched.
[Kou and Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] And there you have it.
011
011b
b06
[Kou] So... What's your point?
[Nikaido] Yeah. What's your point, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] You don't get it yet?
[Kou] Not at all.
[Nikaido] I don't get it.
[Kojiroh] All the other drawers fit fine, except\for the lower right one.
[Kou] ...
[Kojiroh] The drawer on the lower right is\shallower.
[Nikaido] Oh...
[Kou] ...
[Kojiroh] It's about 2 inches shallower.
[Kou] What's that got to do with anything?
[Kojiroh] Two inches is enough for that painting to\fit inside.
[Kou] I see! And that's what the notepad had to do\with it!
[Nikaido] No way!

He shakes the drawer.
b06
[Nikaido] Are you saying...it's in here?!?
011f
[Kojiroh] Perhaps.
[Nikaido] Shit...
Nikaido shakes the drawer
[Kojiroh] Hey! Be gentle!
[Nikaido] Shut up!
Nikaido shakes the drawer some more...
011g
He opens the drawer.
[Kou] Two levels... I see.
[Kojiroh] ?!?
[Nikaido] ...
[Kou] There's nothing inside...
eve_59
[Nikaido] Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!
[Kojiroh] No way...
[Nikaido] There's nothing inside, Kojiroh! ...Huh?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Nikaido] You were right about the two levels, but\there's no painting.
[Kojiroh] Maybe there's another underneath?
[Nikaido] Keep on dreaming.
Nikaido rattles the drawer...
[Nikaido] There's no more.
[Kojiroh] Oh...
[Kou] Well, it was a nice try.
[Nikaido] You idiot!! Ha ha ha ha ha ha... There's\no sign of the painting!
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] (I could've sworn I was right.)
[Kojiroh] (So I was wrong all this time...?)
[Kou] Are you sure, Kojiroh?
[Kojiroh] Maybe I was wrong... I don't think so,\but it could happen.
[Kou] So where is the missing painting!?!
[Kojiroh] Well...
[Kou] Yes?
[Kojiroh] Let's just rethink this thing a bit. I\need to get my thoughts back together again.
[Kou] Alright.
[Kojiroh] The Katsuragi Private Detective Offices\think it's a theft, but I disagree.
[Nikaido] Yeah? So what? Where's the painting then?
[Kou] Oh, quiet, Nikaido! Can't you let Kojiroh\finish a single sentence?
[Nikaido] I have nothing to say to you, Kojiroh.
[Nikaido] How did you know?
[Kojiroh] Call it a hunch.
[Nikaido] You son of a bitch!!
[Kojiroh] I hate to break it to you, but intuitions\come after years of experience and thought...
[Nikaido] You idiot...
[Kojiroh] I'll explain it to you. I was actually\just guessing.
[Nikaido] I... I just don't believe it.
[Kojiroh] Listen, man. I had a strong feeling there\were two levels. But when the cover is opened,\there wasn't anything in there.
[Nikaido] Yeah...
[Kojiroh] Everything appeared to be consistent with\my logic... What more is there to say?
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] That note was there to let us know that\there are two levels.
[Nikaido] What do you mean?
[Kojiroh] And there's nothing in the other drawers.
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] It won't fit in the drawer, check it out,\the depths are different, and there are the two\levels!
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] And when I looked at the bottom, nothing\was there. It confused the hell out of me.
[Nikaido] I can't believe this...
[Kojiroh] The first drawer is only a decoy to stray\you away from the real one.
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] If you check it once and it's not there,\you don't check it again. This is a trick, you see.
[Nikaido] God dammit...
[Nikaido] The drawer with the two levels had\nothing to do with it.
[Kojiroh] (I could've sworn I was right.)
[Nikaido] You were right about the two levels, but\there's no painting.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Nikaido] It's a bluff! A bluff!
[Nikaido] You're just shitting us, Kojiroh.
[Kojiroh] I'm not positive, but I have a hell of a\feeling I'm right.
[Nikaido] ...

　Nikaido
　Kou
[Kojiroh] (They're both looking at me... They\probably want an explanation.)
[Kojiroh] (There wasn't anything in the drawer...)
[Kojiroh] (Was my thought process screwed up along\the way...?)
[Kojiroh] (Kou and Nikaido are both staring at\me...)
[Kojiroh] (Kou and Nikaido are both staring at\me...)
[Kojiroh] (They look as if they're waiting for an\explanation...)
[Kojiroh] (He's staring at me.)
[Kojiroh] (I know how he feel.)
[Kojiroh] (Nikaido's looking down on me.)
[Kojiroh] (Was my reasoning really that far\off...?)
[Kojiroh] (It looks like he hate my guts.)
[Kojiroh] (It looks like he hate my guts.)
[Kojiroh] (I think I can understand how he feel.)
[Kojiroh) (Kou looks...thrilled.)
[Kojiroh] (He looks disappointed...)
[Kojiroh] (Well... I can understand... I did mess\up.)
[Kojiroh] (Kou... He seems to be waiting for an\explanation.)
[Kojiroh] (What the hell am I going to tell him?)
[Kojiroh] (He sure is a weird old bastard.)
　Go outside
[Kou] Are you going home already?
[Kojiroh] Yeah. I've got some things to do.
[Kou] Thanks a lot.
[Kojiroh] It was nice doing business with you. Let\me know if you need another case solved.
[Kou] I'll be sure and do that if the opportunity\arrives.
[Kojiroh] See you later, Nikaido.

[Kojiroh] I checked all the drawers...

[Kojiroh] The upper left, right?
0005b
[Kojiroh] ...Nothing's inside.

[Kojiroh] ...Here's the upper left one.
0005b
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Hey, nothing's in that one.
[Kojiroh] Oh, well. Better close it.
0005
0005e
[Kojiroh] Nothing at all.
0005
[Kojiroh] Okay, I'll open the lower left drawer.
0005e
[Kojiroh] Nothing.
[Kojiroh] I'll just close this up.
0005
[Kojiroh] The upper middle one...?
0005c
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Close this shit.
0005
[Kojiroh] The upper middle one, eh?
0005c
[Kojiroh] There's nothing in this one.
[Kojiroh] ...Close this crap, man.
0005
[Kojiroh] Let's try the lower middle one.
0005f
[Kojiroh] There's the notepad.
0005h
[Kojiroh] Nothing's written on it.
[Kojiroh] Oh well... I'll close it up... Huh?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] There is some marks on it from being\written on... I didn't notice it yesterday.
[Kojiroh] That's because it's just a notepad.
[Kojiroh] When the pen is pushed hard enough, it\leaves grooves in the paper underneath.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Call me crazy, but I think this might be\a clue!
[Kojiroh] Right now I need a soft pencil...
[Kojiroh] I'll bring it over from the desk.
I rummage through the crap on the desk.
[Kojiroh] Here's a nice fountain pen...
[Kojiroh] I'll need a soft pencil...
I keep on searching...
[Kojiroh] Here's a 2B. It should do the trick.
0005
0005h
[Kojiroh] I'll trace the pencil over the grooves...
I move the fine lead over the miniature crevices in the paper.
0005i
[Kojiroh] Okay, I think I'm making some letters\out...
[Kojiroh] It's a little hard to read, but it's not\impossible.
[Kojiroh] It says... to "Search even further!"...?
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] Say what?
[Kojiroh] "Search even further!"... Search for my\balls?
[Kojiroh] I think there's something written beneath\that.
[Kojiroh] ...It's too hard to read. I'll just think\about this one for now.
[Kojiroh] I'll ask Kou what it means... I'm sure\one of his acquaintances wrote it.
[Kojiroh] I'll copy this down.
[Kojiroh] ...
[Kojiroh] This should do it.
[Kojiroh] I'd better put away the notepad.
0005g
And that's what I do.
[Kojiroh] I'll just stick this notepad back in the\drawer.
0005
0005j
I slide the drawer back in.
[Kojiroh] Ah, shit! The pen's in the way. Hope I\didn't break it.
I look around.
[Kojiroh] No one's looking. I'll just pretend that\the pen was broken in the first place.
[Kojiroh] I'd better put it back the way I found\it.
I close it.
[Kojiroh] That's strange, it won't fit.
I jiggle the damn drawer.
[Kojiroh] Is this thing off its tracks?
[Kojiroh] Shoot, I can still see the tip of the\broken pen.
[Kojiroh] I can see the pen tip...
[Kojiroh] And the drawer doesn't shut...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Voice] Hey, what are you doing!
[Kojiroh] Who, me?

[Kou] I'm so sorry... He just barged in.
[Nikaido] Kou, did you give this punk your case?
[Kou] Yes... I'd like try out every possibility.
[Nikaido] But...
[Kojiroh] ...
[Nikaido] What are you doing, Kojiroh!?!
[Kojiroh] Huh? Oh, I was just thinking...
[Kou] About what?
[Kojiroh] I was wondering if I could ask you\something... Do you mind?
[Nikaido] How dare you ignore me!
[Kojiroh] Just shut your goddamn mouth, you\small-peckered son of a bitch.
[Nikaido] ...
[Kojiroh] I'll make it so not even you can\pronounce your name, fartnose. Now, Kou...
[Kou] What may I help you with?
[Kojiroh] This. Read it.
[Kou] It says..."Search even further!" What is it?
[Kojiroh] It's a note I found in a drawer. I just\copied it down.
[Nikaido] Liar! You just wrote it down on a piece\of paper.
[Kojiroh] All I did was trace over it with a\pencil.
[Nikaido] ...
[Kou] Well I don't remember writing this.
[Kojiroh] Did anyone you know write this? Your\secretary or someone?
[Kou] It may have been an acquaintance...
[Kojiroh] Do you know what it means?
[Kou] Hmm...
[Kojiroh] Well?
[Nikaido] What the hell are you getting at,\Kojiroh?
[Kojiroh] What do you think I'm asking Kou for?
[Nikaido] Maybe it's meaningless! Did that ever\occur to you?
[Kojiroh] If you insist on being a complete idiot,\just stay out of it.
[Nikaido] Why, you little...
[Kojiroh] (There must be a connection to the\case...)
[Kojiroh] (The missing painting... The empty\drawers... The strange note...)
[Kojiroh] (There's definitely a connection...)
[Nikaido] Hey Kojiroh... Put the drawer back to\it's original position.
[Kojiroh] (An empty drawer... And the room made to\look like a burglary.)
[Nikaido] Hey, the pen is jammed...
[Kojiroh] The pen is...jammed?
[Nikaido] And it's not where it was in the first\place... I remember everything, you know.
[Kojiroh] !?!
[Kojiroh] Hey, Fido!
[Nikaido] It's Nikaido, dammit!
[Kojiroh] What did you just say??
[Nikaido] It's Nikaido, dammit!
[Kojiroh] No! Before that.
[Nikaido] I said it's not where it was before...
[Kojiroh] That's it!!
[Nikaido] What do you mean?
[Kojiroh] According to my brilliant calculations,\the painting should be right where I think it is.
[Kou and Nikaido] ...!?

[Kojiroh] ...

[Kojiroh] Check the upper right drawer...

[Kojiroh] It's empty.
[Kojiroh] Oh, well. Better close it.
0005
0005g
[Kojiroh] It's empty.

[Kojiroh] Nothing.

[Kojiroh] I'm the only one in this room.
[Kojiroh] Let's look this place over like a\teenager does a girly magazine.
[Kojiroh] Kou ran off to another room.
[Kojiroh] He doesn't like talking to me.
[Kojiroh] According to Kou, the painting was inside\here at one point.
[Kojiroh] I can't get it out of my head... Why not\check it out one more time?
0005
[Kojiroh] Nothing's wrong inside the desk...\Nothing unusual on top, either.
[Kojiroh] It's just an average desk.
[Kojiroh] It's an antique desk...
[Kojiroh] There's a bunch of books, a lamp, a pen\holder, and a notebook on the desk.
[Kojiroh] I looked at the desk yesterday.
[Kojiroh] It's a normal picture...
[Kojiroh] It's an okay painting, but they didn't\put much emotion into it.
[Kojiroh] It's not unusual, nor is there a safe\behind it.
[Kojiroh] Okay, I'll repeat myself: IT'S A NORMAL\PICTURE.
[Kojiroh] There's mud over on the window sill.
[Kojiroh] I thought that was the most suspicious\place when I looked through this place yesterday.
[Kojiroh] It's behind me so I can't see.

[Kojiroh] Outside the window are bushes... That\must be where the mud came from.
[Kojiroh] Someone must've climbed in here from\outside... Ya think?
[Kojiroh] I don't know why they didn't just use the\door...

　Go outside
[Kojiroh] Not yet. There's more to see.
[Kojiroh] I'm here, ain't I? I'd better look around\thoroughly.
